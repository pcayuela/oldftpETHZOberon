Hello,
here you have a basic port of System3 2.2 to HPUX.
It consists of: HS3start.tgz,HS3Sys.Arc,HS3Gad0.Arc.
At first take HS3start.tgz:
> gunzip HS3start.tgz
> tar -xvf HS3start.tar
> oberon
Now please open HS3.Distribution.Tool and follow the 
instructions to extract and compile HS3Sys.Arc,HS3Gad0.Arc.
The following stuff could be also of interest to you:
- HPV4 and documentation
- NetSystem for HPV4 and documentation
- Sources for Linux S3 2.2

Regards Edgar.Schwarz@bk.bosch.de, 1.2.1998

P.S. This is a beta version, which has not been tested in
many installations.  Therefore we would appreciate it if
you would let us know of positive and negative experiences 
installing this.  Please mail to the address above, with
a cc: to muller@inf.ethz.ch.  Thanks.
