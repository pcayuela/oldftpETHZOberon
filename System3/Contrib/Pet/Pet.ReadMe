"Pet stands for "Programmers extentions for ET", ET being the advanced editor of
the basic Oberon System 3. Some of Pet's features are :
	- cursor navigation comparable to commercial editors,
	- Auto-Uppercase of Oberon reserved & predefined identifiers as you type,
	- Auto-Boldface of ASSERT, HALT , EXIT and RETURN keywords as you type,
	- Smart Line Merge.
Of course all the ET goodies remain available."
