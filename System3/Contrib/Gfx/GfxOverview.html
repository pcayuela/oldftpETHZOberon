<H2><A NAME="Introduction"></A>Introduction</H2>
This document gives an overview of a graphics library for Oberon System 3 which focuses on abstract
interfaces and powerful graphical constructs but nevertheless tries to preserve much of the efficiency
granted by the graphical primitives found in the operating system. Although the library currently runs
on Oberon System 3 only, its concepts are independent of underlying operating system and graphics
engine. However, since Oberon is intentionally very simple and only has a small number of graphical
primitives, a graphics library that concentrates on providing advanced graphical capabilities adds the
most value from the perspective of a programmer and best complements the primitive but efficient
routines in the system that are designed to fit the underlying hardware.
<P>
Although general purpose in principle, the library is mainly thought to serve applications for which
powerful and flexible graphics support is crucial, e.g. vector graphics editors or viewers for graphical
documents in standard formats. Its functionality is comparable to that of PostScript (a well known
page description language, trademark of <A HREF=http://www.adobe.com>Adobe Systems, Inc.</A>),
at least in the areas it tackles.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Contexts">Contexts</A></H2>
In the Gfx library, the central entity is called a context, defined as <EM>Gfx.Context</EM>.
A context is an object providing a well-defined set of methods for rendering graphics.
It keeps track of a graphics state consisting of a set of parameters. The graphics state defines
the appearance of whatever is rendered. The context
interface is abstract and is not associated with a specific output device. Only concrete extensions
of the abstract context type are linked to output devices, which allows rendering graphics on real
devices such as displays or printers but also supports rendering to bitmap images or the creation
of textual descriptions of the displayed content, e.g. a page description that can be printed or
exchanged over a network.
<P>
Since Gfx contexts are large and complex objects, we prefer to split their functionality into categories
and introduce these categories one by one.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Paths">Paths</A></H2>
One of the main purposes of any graphics library is to provide functions for drawing basic geometrical
shapes. The Gfx library therefore offers procedures for drawing lines, rectangles, circles and ellipses.
While many drawings can indeed be modelled with only these shapes, other shapes such as arcs, splines,
triangles and parallelograms are often necessary. For this reason, contexts offer a set
of methods for describing arbitrary paths, where a path is defined as a sequence of subpaths and a
subpath in turn is defined as a connected sequence of straight lines, ellipse arcs, and cubic B&eacute;zier
curves.

<H2><A NAME="Paths.Primitives">Primitives</A></H2>
<PRE>
  PROCEDURE DrawLine(ctxt: Context; x0, y0, x1, y1: REAL; mode: SET);
  PROCEDURE DrawArc(ctxt: Context; x, y, r, start, end: REAL; mode: SET);
  PROCEDURE DrawRect(ctxt: Context; x0, y0, x1, y1: REAL; mode: SET);
  PROCEDURE DrawCircle(ctxt: Context; x, y, r: REAL; mode: SET);
  PROCEDURE DrawEllipse(ctxt: Context; x, y, rx, ry: REAL; mode: SET);
</PRE>
<P>
These five procedures are provided as a convenience to programmers since they describe often
used shapes in the domain of vector graphics. Nevertheless, they are not primitive in the sense
that contexts directly render them. What happens instead is that they are decomposed into a
sequence of calls that are described in the next few sections. The mode parameter is explained
in detail in the following section.

<H2><A NAME="Paths.BeginEnd">Beginning and Ending Paths</A></H2>
<PRE>
  CONST
    Record = 0; Fill = 1; Clip = 2; Stroke = 3; EvenOdd = 4;  (* drawing mode elements *)
  
  TYPE
    ContextDesc = RECORD
      ...
      mode: SET;  (* current drawing mode *)
      path: GfxPaths.Path;  (* current path in device coordinates *)
    END;
  
  PROCEDURE Begin(ctxt: Context; mode: SET);
  PROCEDURE End(ctxt);
</PRE>
<P>
When a new path is started, a mode parameter specifies how the path elements are to be interpreted.
<P>
If the mode contains the <EM>Record</EM> element, all path elements are stored in
an explicit path structure. This path structure can then be transformed, its curved elements can be
replaced by an approximation using straight lines, or its elements can be enumerated for further
processing.
<P>
If the mode parameter contains the <EM>Fill</EM> element, the interior of the resulting
path will be filled according to the current fill parameters, whereas the interior of the resulting path
will be intersected with the current clip area and will replace it if the mode contains the
<EM>Clip</EM> element (see section <A HREF="#Clipping">Clipping</A>).
<P>
If the <EM>Stroke</EM> element is present in the mode parameter, an imaginary pen is
led along the path and renders all path elements according to the current stroke parameters.
<P>
Finally, the <EM>EvenOdd</EM> element specifies which areas belong to the interior
of a path. Checking whether a point lies within a path involves drawing an imaginary
ray originating at the point in question and counting how often it intersects the path, every
intersection counting as one if the path crosses the ray from right to left and as minus one
otherwise. If <EM>EvenOdd</EM> is set, the point is inside if the resulting number is
odd, otherwise it is inside if the resulting number is different from zero.

<H2><A NAME="Paths.Subpaths">Entering and Exiting a Subpath</A></H2>
<PRE>
  TYPE
    ContextDesc = RECORD
      ...
      cpx, cpy: REAL;  (* current point in user coordinates *)
    END;
  
  PROCEDURE MoveTo(ctxt: Context; x, y: REAL);
  PROCEDURE Close(ctxt: Context);
</PRE>
<P>
As mentioned above, a subpath is a connected sequence of curves. Calling <EM>MoveTo</EM>
places an imaginary pen at the point which is located at position <EM>(x, y)</EM>. This imaginary pen
then follows all curves that are added to the path until it is lifted off the output plane again, which
happens when <EM>MoveTo</EM> is called again, when the subpath is
terminated with <EM>Close</EM> or <EM>Exit</EM>,
or when the path is terminated with <EM>End</EM>.
The current coordinates of the pen's tip are stored in the
context's <EM>cpx</EM> and <EM>cpy</EM> fields.
<P>
If the subpath defines a closed contour, <EM>Close</EM> should be called. This
automatically appends a line leading to the first point in the subpath if necessary. In
addition, it guarantees that the correct line join style will be rendered at the point
where the subpath is closed.
<P>
The reason for having subpaths in addition to paths is that paths can consist of several disconnected
curve sequences. This is important for areas that have holes, e.g. a ring shape. The ring can be described
as a path consisting of two concentric circular subpaths, one clockwise and the other counter-clockwise.
If the current drawing mode includes the <EM>Fill</EM> element, only the interior area
between these circles is filled, whereas the area of the hole in the center is not affected.
<P>
Gfx offers an alternative way of entering and exiting subpaths which is even more flexible than
the one using <EM>MoveTo</EM> and <EM>Close</EM>:
<P>
<PRE>
  PROCEDURE Enter(ctxt: Context; x, y, dx, dy: REAL);
  PROCEDURE Exit(ctxt: Context; dx, dy: REAL);
</PRE>
<P>
A subpath can be entered at any point with <EM>Enter</EM>. In addition to the
coordinates of the point where the subpath is entered, it expects a vector indicating the
direction of any curve leading to the entry point (very likely the direction of the
last line in a closed subpath). Calling <EM>Enter</EM> with a direction
vector <EM>(0, 0)</EM> is equivalent to calling <EM>MoveTo</EM>.
<P>
Similarly, <EM>Exit</EM> expects as its parameter the direction of the
curve following after the current point (very likely the direction of the first line of
the subpath).
<P>
Using <EM>Enter</EM> and <EM>Exit</EM> is more flexible than
using <EM>MoveTo</EM> and <EM>Close</EM> because closed
subpaths can be rendered piecewise instead of all at once. However, using
<EM>Enter</EM> and <EM>Exit</EM> requires that
directions of adjacent lines at an entry or exit point are known in advance.
More often than not these direction vectors are indeed already known or
can be easily figured out, though, so that it becomes a matter of taste
which method to use.

<H2><A NAME="Paths.Elements">Subpath Elements</A></H2>
<PRE>
  PROCEDURE LineTo(ctxt: Context; x, y: REAL);
  PROCEDURE ArcTo(ctxt: Context; x, y, x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2: REAL);
  PROCEDURE BezierTo(ctxt: Context; x, y, x1, y1, x2, y2: REAL);
</PRE>
<P>
Once a subpath has been started with <EM>MoveTo</EM> or
<EM>Enter</EM>, curve elements can be
added to the current path. They all start drawing at the current point and end at the point
given by <EM>(x, y)</EM>.
<P>
When adding arcs to the path, several additional parameters are needed to describe the
geometry of the ellipse that the arc is part of. The center of the ellipse is at <EM>(x0, y0)</EM>.
The interpretation of control points <EM>(x1, y1)</EM> and <EM>(x2, y2)</EM> is as follows:
in the case of a (counter-clockwise) unit circle, <EM>(x0, y0) = (0, 0), (x1, y1) = (1, 0)</EM>,
and <EM>(x2, y2) = (0, 1)</EM>. Any transformation applied to the unit circle is also applied
to control points, i.e. their position in turn defines the transformation from the unit circle to
the shape of the ellipse. The ellipse always goes through them and their counterparts on the
opposite side of the ellipse center, and its direction at one control point is the same as that
from the center to the other control point. This way of defining an ellipse is more flexible
than just defining its half-axes by length, as is often done, since it handles ellipses that
are not aligned with the coordinate system quite elegantly. If the current point or the end
point are not on the ellipse, a straight line is drawn to or from the nearest point on it.
<P>
In the case of a (cubic) Bezier curve, the additional control points <EM>(x1, y1)</EM> and
<EM>(x2, y2)</EM> define the shape of the curve without lying on the curve themselves.

<H2><A NAME="Paths.Special">Special Procedures</A></H2>
<PRE>
  TYPE
    ContextDesc = RECORD
      ...
      path: GfxPaths.Path;  (* current path *)

    END;
    
  PROCEDURE Flatten(ctxt: Context);
  PROCEDURE Outline(ctxt: Context);
  PROCEDURE Render(ctxt: Context);
</PRE>
<P>
Since some path operations are only possible or at least much easier to perform on sequences
of straight lines, curved path elements may often have to be approximated with straight lines.
<EM>Flatten</EM> visits all elements of the current path and replaces arcs and
beziers by sequences of short lines. The maximal distance between the original curve and the
approximation is no bigger than the current value of the flatness parameter stored in the context,
which helps control the quality of the approximation.
<P>
<EM>Outline</EM> replaces the current path by a new path which outlines all
areas that would be drawn to if the current path were stroked. This is of course only useful
for reasonably thick lines. If the current line width is zero, <EM>Outline</EM>
does not create an outlined path at all. However, if a dash pattern is in effect, the path
is replaced by its dashed representation.
<P>
<EM>Render</EM> renders the current path using the current context attributes.
This is useful if some attributes are not known in advance or if subpaths have to be modified
after construction. The rendering mode can then be set to <EM>Record</EM>.
When the path is complete, attributes can be set to the appropriate values or the path
can be modified before calling <EM>Render</EM> to output the path. Note
that the current path is always stored in device coordinates.

</PRE>
<P>
Context attributes have an effect on how paths are rendered. Whenever they are modified,
they remain in their new state until they are changed again. It is good practice to save any previous
value before modifying an attribute and later revert to the previous value unless you are sure that
the old value will not be needed anymore. If many attributes have to be modified at once, the
whole graphics state or parts of it can be saved with <EM>Save</EM> and later be
restored with <EM>Restore</EM>. Note that attributes may only be
changed as long as no path has been begun. While within a path, attribute values remain
locked and cannot be changed, except for the current font and flatness values.
<P>
The color used for stroking a path or filling its interior can be set with <EM>SetStrokeColor</EM>
and <EM>SetFillColor</EM>. Gfx maintains two distinct color attributes for stroking and
filling because it can execute both at once for the same path. Colors are represented as RGB-triples.
Frequently used colors are exported from Gfx as global variables.
<P>
In addition to solid color, a bitmap pattern may be used for stroking and filling paths. The pattern
must first be instanced from the context with <EM>NewPattern</EM> by specifying
an image and a pin-point,
which is the point where the pattern is anchored. For pure alpha images, the current
stroke and fill colors are used. A NIL pattern turns
pattern mode off and returns to solid color.
<P>
Stroked curves may also be dashed, which means that only some parts of the curve are rendered
while others are left out according to a repeating pattern. A dash pattern is defined by two
sequences of numbers. For each dash, the number in the first sequence denotes the length
of a visible part, whereas the corresponding number in the second sequence denotes the
length of the following invisible part. Furthermore, a phase
parameter defines where within the pattern to start when entering a subpath. Dashed curves
should be turned off again by calling <EM>SetDashPattern</EM> with a pattern
length of zero rather than with a dash pattern that has zero distance between dashes.
<P>
By default curves have a width of one pixel, but the current line width can be changed. Setting
the line width to zero renders curves with as few pixels as possible, depending on the resolution
of the rendering device. When line width is significantly over one pixel, the question of how to
render line caps and line joins arises. Gfx provides the most common ones as predefined constants:
butt caps (default), round caps, and square caps for line caps and miter
joins (default), round joins, and bevel joins for line joins. If no precautions are taken, miter joins
may extend far away from the original corner point. Gfx introduces
a context attribute called <EM>styleLimit</EM> to counter this effect. A style must not draw
pixels whose distance from the original curve is larger than <EM>1/2 * lineWidth * styleLimit.</EM>
Miter joins are replaced by bevel joins if they would extend beyond that limit.
<P>
As already mentioned, curved segments are often approximated with straight lines. The
<EM>flatness</EM> attribute controls the quality of the approximation. Its default value is one,
making the maximal error tolerated in approximations at most one pixel. Contrary to
all other attributes, the flatness is measured in device pixels, not in the user coordinate
system.
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Transformations">Coordinate Systems and Transformations</A></H2>
As outlined in the previous sections, an application controlling a context may not know on
which device its output will finally appear. Since pixel resolution usually varies from one
output device to another, device pixel coordinates are not a suitable means for specifying
device independent coordinates. Instead, when a context is initialized, a default coordinate
system is established which has is origin at the lower left corner of the area that can be
rendered to. The units of the default coordinate system correspond to those of the Oberon
display, where one unit is approximately 1/91 inch.
<P>
Whenever point coordinates are passed to the graphics library, e.g. when drawing path segments,
the current transformation is applied to them. Initially the current transformation maps a point in
the default coordinate system to the corresponding point in the coordinate system of the underlying
output device, but the current transformation can be changed anytime, even within paths.
Many attributes of the context are also affected by the current transformation, including dash
pattern, line width, font size and orientation, etc.
<P>
The current transformation is represented in the context as a 3-by-2 matrix, so that a point
<EM>(x, y)</EM> in the current context coordinate system is mapped to a point <EM>(x', y')</EM>
in the following way:
<P><EM>
x' = m00*x + m10*y + m20<BR>
y' = m01*x + m11*y + m21
</EM>
<P>
This way of representing the current transformation not only allows to arbitrarily scale
and translate the coordinate system but also to rotate and shear it.
<P>

</PRE>
<P>
ResetCTM initializes the current transformation matrix (CTM) to its default state, which maps
points specified in Oberon display units to device coordinates. <EM>SetCTM</EM>
sets the CTM to a specific value. This should only be used for restoring a value that has temporarily
been modified, otherwise results are no longer guaranteed to have equal size and orientation
on all output devices.
<P>
The remaining procedures for modifying the CTM all combine their arguments with the CTM
such that the transformation they describe is applied to a point before all other transformations
in the CTM are applied to it. Translate moves the origin of the coordinate system by <EM>(dx, dy)</EM>,
<EM>Scale</EM> scales <EM>x</EM> coordinates by <EM>sx</EM> and <EM>y</EM>
coordinates by <EM>sy</EM>, <EM>ScaleAt</EM> moves the origin to <EM>(x, y)</EM>
before scaling and back afterwards, <EM>Rotate</EM> rotates counter-clockwise by
the angle whose sine and cosine are given, <EM>RotateAt</EM> moves the origin to
<EM>(x, y)</EM> before rotating and back afterwards, and <EM>Concat</EM> combines
its argument with the CTM.
<P>
While graphical context attributes cannot be changed within a path, the current
transformation may be modified anytime, even within subpaths. When a path is begun,
the contents of the CTM are therefore copied into the current attribute matrix (CAM),
which is used for transforming graphical context attributes

SetFont and SetFontName are for changing the current font of the context.
<P>
<EM>Show</EM> and <EM>ShowAt</EM> may only be called
while inside a path. They append character outlines to the current path and advance
the current point. Character shapes may therefore be stroked or used for clipping,
but only if the necessary outline font files are installed, otherwise an undefined
outline path in the form of a rectangle will be used. However, if the mode is set to
<EM>Fill</EM>, Gfx does not even look at character outlines and uses
precomputed raster fonts from corresponding raster font files.
<P>
<EM>DrawString</EM> and <EM>DrawStringAt</EM> are
convenience procedures which begin a path in <EMFill</EM> mode, call
<EM>Show</EM> and <EM>ShowAt</EM>, respectively,
to display the string, and end the path. They obviously cannot be called while inside
a path and use the current fill attributes for rendering individual characters.
<P>
<EM>GetStringWidth</EM> returns the distance that the current point
would be moved if the specified string were rendered. <EM>dy</EM> is usually zero
but can have other values if the current font has been rotated or sheared.
<P>
The fact that contexts work in a device independent manner makes it difficult to use
Oberon raster fonts directly because Oberon raster font files have both their resolution
and their point size hardcoded into their name (e.g. "Oberon10b.Pr3.Fnt" contains
raster data for the Oberon family in bold style at size ten for use on a 300 dpi printer).
Even if the extension is replaced by the one corresponding to the current output device,
the problem remains that the point size may not be the appropriate one because the
CTM might have been scaled. An additional abstraction for representing fonts is therefore
needed, which is encapsulated in module GfxFonts.

<P>
Fonts are defined by their name, which consists of family and style (e.g. "Oberon-Bold"),
a point size, and an instance matrix. The instance matrix is usually an identity matrix scaled to
the resolution of a specific output device. The Oberon display is represented by
an identity matrix, in which case OpenSize can be used. However, other affine
transformations are possible as well, resulting in arbitrarily scaled, rotated, and
sheared characters. Translations are ignored.
<P>
Once a font has been opened, image bitmaps and outline paths may be retrieved for single
characters. Since devices such as the Oberon display include optimized code for rendering
Oberon raster fonts, the <EM>rfont</EM> field contains a link to the corresponding Oberon font if a
suitable one exists.
<P>
GfxFonts is able to read Oberon raster font and files and metafonts (containing outlines).
Besides, a plugin mechanism for extending the number of known font formats is supported.
Currently there is a plugin called GfxOType for using TrueType fonts within Gfx, which
depends on the OpenType package for Oberon System 3, and a plugin called GfxPKFonts
for accessing TeX's pk fonts. Plugins must be registered in Oberon.Text, as described in

<P>
Raster contexts are a context extension designed for dealing with raster devices. Their
main property is that they perform scan conversion of path elements and call their <EM>dot</EM>
or <EM>rect</EM> method to render homogeneous areas. Several modules rendering to
concrete devices are based on GfxRaster contexts: GfxDisplay for rendering to the Oberon
display, GfxBuffer for rendering into image bitmaps, GfxPrinter for using the Oberon printer.

<H2><A NAME="Postscript">PostScript Contexts</A></H2>
Even if certain Oberon printer drivers are capable of producing PostScript descriptions,
the results are often not satisfactory, not necessarily because of quality but because huge
files are created which take a long time to transmit and print. Module GfxPS therefore
implements a special context extension that maps context methods to corresponding
PostScript operations and writes them to a file.

  DEFINITION GfxPS;
  
  TYPE
    Context = POINTER TO ContextDesc;
    ContextDesc = RECORD (GfxContexts.ContextDesc)
      psfile: Files.File;  (* output file *)
      out: Files.Rider;  (* rider on output file *)
      width, height: REAL;  (* paper size in default coordinates *)
      left, bot, right, top: REAL;  (* borders in default coordinates *)
      level2, landscape, eps: BOOLEAN;
      res: LONGINT;  (* device resolution *)
    END;
    
  PROCEDURE Init(psc: Context; level2, landscape: BOOLEAN; width, height, left, right, bot, top: REAL; res: LONGINT);
  PROCEDURE InitEPS(psc: Context; level2: BOOLEAN; res: LONGINT);
  PROCEDURE Open(psc: Context; file: Files.File);
  PROCEDURE ShowPage(psc: Context);
  PROCEDURE Close(psc: Context);
</PRE>
<P>
The difference between <EM>Init</EM> and <EM>InitEPS</EM> is that
<EM>InitEPS</EM> initializes the context such that <EM>ShowPage</EM>
has no effect and that no document structuring comments referring to page numbering are
produced. In addition, <EM>InitEPS</EM> does not restrict output to the given
media size and does not provide a landscape option.
<P>
Once initialized, the context can be opened on a supplied file with <EM>Open</EM>.
A prolog (GfxProlog.ps) containing several procedures and data structures common to all
produced output files is first written to the file. After opening a context, all context
procedures are converted to PostScript code and appended to the file.
<P>
When printing whole documents, <EM>ShowPage</EM> should be called whenever
a page has been fully rendered, resulting in some code and comments being appended to the file
and a new blank page being readied for output.
<P>
Once all pages have been generated, <EM>Close</EM> must be called to add some
finishing code and comments and to register the file.
