This modules are for DATA TRANSLATION's DT3155,  high-accurancy monochrome PCI bus Frame Grabber.

Operating as a Bus Master on a high- speed PCI bus, the DT3155 transfers images continuously, in real time, 
to the system monitor for display or to system memory for storage.

I write this module by using Hardware Technical Reference for DT3155 V1.10 and source program written in C for
DOS, which can be found in Data Translation'web site "http://www.datx.com/".

These modules are working for me but for you may not. If you find any errors or have any commends please
