New in release 1.3:

- bug fixex.

- The files SSHDSAHostskeys.Text and SSHRSAHostkeys.Text 
got merged to SSHHostkeys.Text.

- New module cryptPrimes.Mod for generating large safe prime 
numbers.

- Module cryptDSA is finished (includes signing now).

- Improved performance.

I've tuned the performace of multi pecision integers
(cryptBigNumbers.Mod). The time for establishing a SSH-
connection, which is mainlly determined by the computation 
of '(a^p) mod m' in the Diffie Hellman key exchange, could be 
reduced by a factor of nearly three but is still more than
two times greater than with the original SSH.

This was the first time I really missed unsigned integer types 
in the Oberon language. In the old implementation of
cryptBigNumbers multi precision integers had been represented 
by 8 bit digits because of ease of coding (no overflow- and sign 
problems when computing the values in LONGINT). In the
new implementation the 'digits' are 32 bit. Unfortunateley
a lot of the benefit of using larger digits gets lost by the 
additional effort for treating the sign bit and overflow 
conditions. With the availability of the Modula2 CARDINAL 
type (and CARDINAL64) coding would have been much easier
and (still more important) the code would have been faster.
