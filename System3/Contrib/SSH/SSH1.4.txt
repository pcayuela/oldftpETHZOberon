New in 1.4:

- Module BigNumbers got further improved (faster) by 
   using Montgomery multplications in procedure ModExp.

- New IDEA cipher. The previous version (takern from the old
   module Crypt.Mod) worked also well but the encryption was 
   incompatible with the external world IDEA ciphers. 
   Paricularly unpleasant as IDEA was developed at ETH!
   
- New cipher CAST. Not really needed for SSH but CAST is
   the main cipher in recent PGP implementaions.
   
- Module cryptRSA has been finished. 

- Support for RSA hostkeys added in module SSHKeys.

- fixed a bug in procedure deriveKey in module SSHTransport.
