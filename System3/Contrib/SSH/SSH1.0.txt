Hi Pieter

  I finally got Oberon SSH finished. Appended you will find the release 1.0 
archive. The remote copy functions (SSH.Receive and SSH.Send) are now
implemented but the remote host key checking is still left out (needs
additional crypt stuff).

  I followed your advice and renamed all files with a common prefix
('crypt' for the crypt stuff and 'SSH' for the SSH related modules). Most
of the modules got reworked in order to make them more readable.
The crypt modules are independent of the SSH stuff and could be used
for an SSL implementation as well.

  The SSH package has been tested to work with all the compilers 
used in the Unix ports of ETH Oberon (x86,  SPARC,  PowerPC).
