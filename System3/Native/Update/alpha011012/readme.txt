ETH Oberon is a personal computer operating system based on the
Oberon language and system. It was developed at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) -- also the
birthplace of Pascal and Modula-2. The system contains a simple
but powerful programming environment and many other
applications. It runs on personal computers with Intel 486,
Pentium or similar processors and at least 8MB of RAM and 30MB
of free disk space. A two- or three-button mouse is required.

Oberon is typically installed in its own partition on a hard
disk, but there is also a version of the system that can be
installed in an existing DOS- or Windows-formatted partition.

To install the system, create the installation diskette from the
Oberon0.Dsk floppy image file by running the rawrite.exe tool
under DOS or Windows. Then boot the installation diskette and
follow the on-screen instructions.

Further information about the system and language can be
obtained on the web at http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/ and the latest
version of the system can always be downloaded from this site.
Other Oberon programming environments (for Windows, Linux etc.)
can also be downloaded for free.
