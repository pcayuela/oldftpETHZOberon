Native Oberon System 3 Release 2.3.6 (DOS-based)

This directory contains a compressed version of DOS-based Native Oberon.
This version is installed via DOS, uses DOS as a bootstrap loader and
embeds the Oberon file system in a large DOS file, so it does not require
a separate disk partition.  Refer to the stand-alone version documentation
for hardware requirements, additional package installation, legal
information and contact address.

The file is compressed with zip and split into diskette-sized parts.

To regenerate the .zip file on DOS, run combine.bat and then use
PKunzip or WinZip to uncompress the file.

See http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/native/ for more information.
