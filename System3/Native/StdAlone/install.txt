ETH Native Oberon System 3 Release 2.3.6 (Stand-alone)


Native Oberon is a self-contained operating system for Intel-based
personal computers. The latest information about the system is
available at http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/native/

This text describes how to install stand-alone Native Oberon. We
recommend printing it for reference during installation. The
stand-alone version is best installed in a separate partition on
the hard disk. A DOS-based version of Native Oberon is also
available, which boots from DOS or Windows 95. Refer to the
separate installation documentation on installing the DOS-based
version.


1. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The system runs on the bare PC in 32-bit mode, and does not use the
16-bit drivers in the PC BIOS, or drivers from other operating
systems.

The *minimum* hardware requirements are:
  Processor: 80386, Pentium or compatible
  Bus: ISA, EISA or PCI
  Memory: 4Mb
  Disk space: 3Mb
  Disk controller: IDE, EIDE (ATA), ESDI, Adaptec AIC 7xxx (beta),
Adaptec 1520 or NCR 810 SCSI
  Display controller: VGA (SVGA recommended)
  Diskette: Drive supporting 720k/1.44Mb media
  Mouse: PS/2 or serial mouse (3-button recommended)
  Keyboard: US, UK, Swiss German, German, Canadian, Norwegian,
Turkish, Polish, French or Dvorak

The following optional hardware are supported:
  NIC: 3Com 3C509 Etherlink III or 3C905B FastEtherLink
  Dialup: Standard modem (not WinModem) with SLIP or PPP internet
service provider
  Sound: Soundblaster


2. INSTALLATION DISKETTE

To install the system, an installation diskette must be available.
This diskette can be created by writing the installation diskette
image file (oberon0.dsk) to a formatted 1.44Mb diskette. This is
done using the DOS rawrite.exe program provided or the Unix dd
tool. Note that the install diskette is a bootable diskette that
can not be read by DOS.

2.1 Creating the diskette on DOS

Run rawrite.exe and enter the image name (oberon0.dsk) when
prompted for a source file name. Assuming that a: is a diskette
drive containing a 1.44Mb formatted diskette, enter "a" when
prompted for a destination drive. The diskette image is written to
the diskette and verified.

The same procedure can be used on Windows 95/NT or OS/2. (On OS/2
the loaddskf utility can also be used instead of rawrite.exe. Use:
"loaddskf oberon0.dsk a:").

2.2 Creating the diskette on Unix

Place a 1.44Mb formatted diskette in the drive (say /dev/fd0) and
enter the command "dd bs=512 if=oberon0.dsk of=/dev/fd0" to write
the image to the diskette.


3. INSTALLING NATIVE OBERON

The installation diskette contains Oberon-0. This is a small
ramdisk-based Native Oberon system which is used to install the
basic Native Oberon system on a hard disk.

Standalone Native Oberon can co-exist with other operating systems
on the same hard disk in at least three ways:

o Separate bootable partition with boot manager. A boot manager
  (not supplied) allows booting of Oberon or other operating
  systems.
o Separate bootable partition without boot manager. Oberon boots
  directly from the hard disk. The other operating system is booted
  from a diskette.
o Separate non-bootable partition. The Oberon kernel is booted from
  a diskette and then proceeds to load from the hard disk.

3.1 Booting the installation diskette

Insert the installation diskette and switch on the machine. It will
display "OBERON System 3" and then display the "OBL>" prompt. Here
configuration strings can be entered before continuing the boot
process. In the normal case, no additional configuration strings
are required, so simply enter "c" to continue. The screen will go
blank, and the diskette will become active again while the ramdisk
is initialized. In less than a minute the Oberon screen will appear
with a colorful pattern, and then the mouse configuration program
will appear. You must configure the mouse by following the
on-screen instructions before continuing. If the Oberon screen does
not appear, see the troubleshooting section of this document.

Important: If the QNX operating system is installed on your system,
the default partition type of Native Oberon must be changed to
avoid conflicts by entering "PartType=80" at the OBL prompt. (The
Technical section of the Native Oberon web site documents more
configuration options).

3.2 First-time Oberon users

If you have never used Oberon before, you will have to get used to
its novel user interface. A small tuturial is included in the
Oberon-0 system. To open the tutorial text, move the mouse cursor
to the first blue-colored "Edit.Open" command in the Install.Tool
text, and press the middle mouse button on a three-button mouse. If
you only have a two-button mouse, the keyboard Ctrl key is used
instead of the middle mouse button. (Oberon uses all combinations
of the three mouse buttons heavily, so a three-button mouse is
highly recommended).

The "Edit.Open" command described above will open a text called
Introduction.Text, which introduces the concepts of the Oberon user
interface necessary to continue the installation process.

3.3 Using Oberon-0 to install Oberon

The Install.Tool text contains instructions for installing Oberon.
Only the first page is relevant when installing the system the
first time. The rest of the text contains "appendices" on various
topics.

1. Select the appropriate disk driver from one of the options
provided. Do this by executing the relevant blue command by
clicking the middle button on it. The command will display your
selection in the system log. It might take a couple of seconds for
the driver to initialize.

2. Install the Oberon system files on your hard disk. Open the tool
provided and follow the instructions there. The tool presents
several options, of which you have to choose one. Take a few
minutes to understand the different options presented. (If you need
to free up partition space for Oberon, a product like
PartitionMagic or the freely available FIPS can be used).

3. Configure the system by specifying the display and keyboard
driver and, if required, modifying the customization options. Then
write the configuration using at least one of the options
presented. That's it!

Note that you can use Oberon-0 at any time to reconfigure your
existing system. Boot the installation diskette and go to step 3 in
Install.Tool.

If at any time during installation a trap viewer or an error
message appears that can not be explained, contact the author at
the address mentioned below. Please note exactly what happened, and
if possible follow the instructions in Appendix C of Install.Tool.

3.4 Optional packages

The basic Oberon system that has been installed above is a fully
functional Oberon programming environment containing text and
documentation editors, networking (Telnet and Mail) and an Oberon
compiler.

In addition, the following optional packages are available. They
are installed from within Oberon (not Oberon-0).

Gadgets: Graphical user interface & WWW tools
Documentation: Guides, examples & book (requires Gadgets)
Applications: Additional applications (requires Gadgets)
Tutorials: Old hypertext tutorials for Gadgets (requires Gadgets)
Pr3Fonts: 300 dpi Oberon Fonts for printing
Pr6Fonts: 600 dpi Oberon Fonts (for PostScript printer only)
Source code: Full sources of the system, excluding the Kernel and
some beta code

The Gadgets package contains the Gadgets graphical user interface
framework and some standard Gadgets-based applications. Rembrandt
is used to edit bitmaps and Leonardo is used for complex line-based
illustrations. All standard applications are reachable via
hyperlinks from the System3.Tool text. The Gadgets framework
supports window tiling (useful for programming or text editing) and
a desktop interface with arbitrary window overlapping. The Gadgets
package also contains additional Internet tools: a simple WWW
browser, a Mail tool with Oberon document support, an FTP tool and
Gopher, News and Finger clients. All the additional tools are
reachable from the Network.Tool text. The Gadgets package is a
prerequisite.

The Documentation package contains extensive documentation and
examples about Oberon System 3 and the Gadgets framework and
applications, as well as an electronic copy of the Oberon Companion
book. The SamplePrograms.Tool lists the examples and the
Documentation.Tool contains links to all the documentation.

The Applications package has several additional applications and
games contributed by ETH students and other Oberon users. The
Applications.Tool has links to all the applications. Most of the
applications require the Gadgets package, and some require
networking support.

The Tutorials package contains hypertext-based tuturials (now
slightly out of date) for the Oberon system. The Gadget packages is
required.

The Pr3Fonts (300dpi) and Pr6Fonts (600dpi) printer font packages
are only necessary when a printer driver is configured. Currently
only the PostScript and LPR printer drivers support 600dpi
printing.

The sources are only required if you want to study or modify the
system.

3.5 Installing packages

The packages are distributed as Oberon-compressed .arc files. These
files must reside on a DOS-format hard disk or diskette drive
during package installation. This means they have to be copied from
the Internet or distribution CD to a local hard disk or to
DOS-formatted diskettes. The following table lists the package file
names and approximate installed size (Mb compressed and Mb
uncompressed) and shows how the files could be distributed on 7
diskettes (plus one for Oberon-0) for further installation.

PACKAGE        FILENAME        SIZE   DSK 
------------------------------------------
Oberon-0       oberon0.dsk             0
Gadgets        gadgets.arc   1.4  2.9  1
Documentation  docu.arc      1.3  2.5  2
Applications   apps.arc      1.3  2.8  3
Tutorials      tutorial.arc  0.3  0.8  4
Pr3Fonts       pr3fonts.arc  0.3  0.6  4
Pr6Fonts       pr6fonts.arc  0.5  1.8  4
Source1        source1.arc   0.9  2.5  5
Source2        source2.arc   1.2  3.5  6
Source3        source3.arc   0.6  1.7  7

During installation some temporary disk space is required.
Therefore you will need about 30% more disk space than indicated
above (30Mb is enough for all packages).

To install one or more packages from within Native Oberon, open the
System.Text with the Script.Open command provided at the top of the
System.Tool and follow the instructions in the section "Installing
the optional packages".


4. ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION INFORMATION

4.1 Appendices in Install.Tool

The Install.Tool in Oberon-0 contains appendices with additional
commands that may be useful for recovery purposes. Appendix A
describes how to reactivate the previous operating system if the PC
does not boot any more. Appendix B describes how to recover a
Native Oberon file system with a damaged directory. Appendix C
suggests how to send an error report to the author. Appendix D
contains commands for advanced users.

4.2 Disk drivers

The new "Standard ATA/EIDE" driver is recommended for all IDE and
EIDE drives, and should detect most modern drives (>100 Mb)
automatically. The new driver is incompatible with the old Atapi CD
driver. Symptom: When a button on the CDAudio.Panel is pressed, a
TRAP 8 occurs in Kernel.InstallIP. Workaround: Set config string
IDE1=0 at the OBL> prompt when installing the system, or at a later
time. This disables access to the secondary controller and allows
the old Atapi CD driver to control the CD connected to the
secondary controller.

For older IDE drives (e.g. WD93044-A), the "Standard IDE (old)"
driver is recommended. This driver supports only one controller and
assumes it is at the standard primary addresses IRQ 14, IO base
1F0H & 3F6H. If your controller is not located at this address, or
if your hard disk for Oberon is on the secondary IDE controller,
you can configure the correct values at the initial OBL> prompt.
For example, if the secondary controller is at IRQ 15 and IO base
170H & 376H, enter: "IDE=15,170H,376H". You also have to specify
the disk size manually using a string like "Disk0=1200Mb" (example
for 1.2Gb disk). It is safe to specify a value smaller than the
actual disk size.

The "Adaptec 1520 SCSI" driver parameters can also be configured at
the OBL> prompt. For example, if the controller is at IRQ 12, port
140H and host id 5, enter: "AHA1520=12,140H,5". The default values
are IRQ 11, port 340H and host id 7.

The "NCR 810 SCSI" driver supports NCR PCI cards and configures
itself automatically.

The new "Adaptec AIC7xxx" driver also supports PCI cards only and
configures itself automatically. It should work on most modern
Adaptec SCSI cards, e.g. the 2940 family.

Important: If any of the disk drivers produce a "trap" during
installation, please make detailed notes on the trap information
and report it to Oberon help (address below). It is wise to switch
the machine off completely after such a trap, to ensure the
controller is reset completely.

4.3 Linux LILO boot manager

The Linux LILO boot manager can be used to load Native Oberon.
Install Native Oberon as described above. Then boot Linux, log in
as root and run "fdisk -l". Look for a partition of type 0x4f (the
Oberon partition), say /dev/hda2. Edit /etc/lilo.conf, adding a
section like the following:

other=/dev/hda2
  label=Oberon
  loader=/boot/chain.b

Execute "lilo" to initialize the boot manager. It will say "Adding
Oberon" (among other things). Oberon will now appear in the LILO
menu when you boot.

You can also boot Native Oberon from a logical drive using LILO. To
do this you must create the Oberon partition using Linux fdisk, and
then use OPTION 3 (overwrite a partition or logical drive) in step
2 of the installation process.

Native Oberon has been tested successfully with the OS/2,
PartitionMagic and Windows NT boot managers. Read the documentation
supplied with those products for installation information. For
Windows NT, the freely available Bootpart utility can be useful.


5. TROUBLESHOOTING

5.1 Oberon-0 does not boot

If the "OBERON System 3" message does not appear, or only the first
few characters appear, it is very likely that the install diskette
contains bad sectors. Use another diskette, or reformat it (not
quick-format) and try again.

If the screen goes blank, and the Oberon display does not appear,
there might be compatibility problems between the Native Oberon
drivers and your PC. To help us track down these problems, please
do the following:

o Boot with the install diskette.
o At the "OBL>" prompt, enter the following command: "Init=9090".
o Enter "c" to continue booting.

Some trace information will appear in red on the screen. If a
run-time error occurs, TRAP xx will be displayed and at the end
will be a list of module names with PC = nnn values. It might be
possible to infer from this what is causing the problem. If not,
please send the first few lines of the module name information, as
well as the number of the TRAP to us. This will help us pinpoint
the error in the source code.

If no trace messages appear, it could mean that the CPU type
detection is not functioning on your processor. Override the
detection by entering a command of the form "CPU=n" at the "OBL>"
prompt, where n is 3 for a 386, 4 for a 486 and 5 for a Pentium or
compatible processor.

5.2 Black screen when booting Oberon

If the screen stays black when booting a successfully installed
system for the first time, there could be device driver conflicts.
Boot Oberon-0 again and try with some other display device drivers
(e.g. the standard VGA driver, or the VESA 2.0 driver, if your
display is VESA 2.0 compliant). You may skip step 2 (installing the
files).

If this still does not work, try the following:

o While booting the installed Oberon system (from boot diskette or
  partition), hold down a shift key or activate ScrollLock. The
  "OBL>" prompt will appear, allowing you to edit the configuration
  strings.
o Continue as described in the previous section (Oberon-0 does not
  boot). Some trace information will appear on the screen, which
  will help to locate the problem.

If the "black screen" symptom occurs after the system has
functioned correctly for some time, the file system might have been
corrupted, or a system module may have been overwritten or deleted.
Boot the install diskette (Oberon-0). Then execute
Install.Directory to see if the directory is accessible. If no trap
occurs, the file system is probably intact, and you can re-install
the basic system modules using the "update" option in step 2. If
Install.Directory causes a trap, the file directory is corrupt.
Reboot Oberon-0 again and use the Scavenger commands in Appendix B
to rebuild the directory, as explained below.

Execute Scavenger.Scan to scan through the whole file system for
file headers and build a new directory in memory (this takes long).
Scavenger.Display can optionally be used to display the list of
files found. Then use Scavenger.WriteDirectory to write the new
directory. In case multiple versions of a file is found, the
Scavenger recovers the one with the latest time and date. It should
therefore only be used as a last resort, and only if the real-time
clock of the PC functions correctly.

5.3 Grey screen when booting Oberon

If the installed system seems to boot correctly, but displays a
grey screen instead of the default viewers, there is probably
something wrong in Oberon.Text. Press Ctrl-Break to get a trap
viewer to type commands. Type the command Edit.Open Oberon.Text (or
ET.Open) and middle click on it to open the configuration text.
Check if the braces and quotes in recently-edited parts of the text
occur in matching pairs.

5.4 NetSystem configuration problems

To help trace network configuration problems, the NetSystem module
has a command NetSystem.Show, which displays the current network
parameters. Other network modules contain some global counter
variables that can be viewed with System.State ^. The most useful
counters are in the Net3Com509 module (the 3Com EtherNet driver).
Nsent counts the number of EtherNet packets sent and Nreceived
counts the number of packets received. There are also Nsent and
Nreceived counters in modules NetIP, NetUDP, NetTCP and NetDNS.
