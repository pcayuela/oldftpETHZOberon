Linux Native Oberon ( 27.Jan.2002 )


Linux Native Oberon is an emulation of Native Oberon for Linux. The goal is 
not a tight integration in the Linux environment but binary compatibility 
with Native Oberon. For information  about Native Oberon see the homepage at
http://www.oberon.ethz.ch/native/

To install this release you need:
- Linux with X11, of course
- the Oberon0.Dsk file from Native Oberon (download from LinuxBased)
- 10 Mb free disk space, or Native Oberon beta 31.07.00 running.
  40 Mb disk space is recommended if all packages are to be installed

Linux Native Oberon doesn't change the interface of any module. All driver 
modules which are changed for LNO are statically linked in oberon.lno. 
If you first install Native Oberon and than LNO on an own partition you
will be able to start Oberon from both Native or Linux.

Installation:

1) Make a new directory, copy lno020127.tgz and Oberon0.Dsk to it and make
it the current directory (the LNO directory).

2) Uncompress lno020127.tgz with "tar xzf lno020127.tgz". This will expand to:
 
install		the core for installation
oberon		the command for libc6
oberon.libc5	the command for libc5
oberon.lno	the inner core of Oberon and the LNO drivers statically linked 
oberon.cnf	the configuration file
oberon.xpm	an icon for Oberon
oberon.c	the source of the bootloader
LNO.tgz		Linux Native Oberon specific files

3) Get the *.zip files of the optional packages you want to install from
the LinuxBased directory an copy them to your LNO directory.

4) If you want to update a Native Oberon partition make a symbolic link to
that partition. For example, "ln -s /dev/hda1 oberon.dsk" where /dev/hda1
is your Oberon partition. Set read/write permissions to that partition:
"chmod 600 /dev/hda1".  Then go to step 7 to start Oberon-0, and use options
1, 5 and 6.

5) If you want to use an existing disk file in a DOS FAT partition, make a
symbolic link to that file. For example, "ln -s /dos/system3/native.dsk 
oberon.dsk". Be sure to have read/write permissions to that file.
Then go to step 7 to start Oberon-0, and use options 2, 5 and 6.

6) If you want to create a new empty disk file just go to the next step,
and create the file from within Oberon-0, using options 3, 5 and 6.
(Note that the current beta version has a bug which does not allow
formatting an oberon.dsk file larger than 32 Mb.)

7) Be sure that the oberon0.dsk file (if any) is in the current directory
and execute "oberon -c install". The Linux-based version of Oberon-0 will
appear, allowing you to install the files.  Finish with option 6, System.Quit.

8) Execute "oberon" to run the installed system.  Open Linux.Tool to mount
the linux file system and install the *.arc files.

To execute oberon, the oberon directory must be the current directory. If the
current directory is not in the path you must execute "./oberon" . The oberon
disk files must be read/write accessible. If a Native printer is used, the 
printing device must be read/write accessible. To use the floppy, you need 
read/write access to the floppy device /dev/fd? .

Options:
-h size	  set the heapsize to size in Mb ( default 12 Mb )
-d file   use file as Linux Native Oberon disk file ( default oberon.dsk )
-c file	  use file as statically linked oberon core ( default oberon.lno )

oberon.log gives some hints if something goes wrong.

9) To copy other files (e.g. gadgets.arc etc.) to your LNO disk, execute 
System.Open Linux.Tool and use the Linux.cp2o command there.

The following drivers are implemented: 
Input, Disk, Display, Diskette0, Diskette, LinuxPrinter, Centronics, V24, CD

Sound and Linux NetSystem are not implemented. SLIP and PPP connections work, 
because they use the serial port.

Implementation specific things:
- Kernel.SetClock is not implemented.
  ( only super user would be allowed to set the clock)
- the display is buffered in the heap
- Snapshot doesn't support 16/32 bit displays
- the Linux Module offers Linux spezific commands. Read Linux.Tool!

Configuration:
The display size and some other things can be configured in oberon.cnf

Differences from PC Native Oberon:
- Hard break is ctrl-c from the terminal window
- Quit is ctrl-z from the terminal window
- System.Reboot is equal to System.Quit

Known bugs:
- LNO is terminated when the stack is full

To include oberon into the menu of your desktop environment or window manager, 
make a small script  like this:

#!/bin/sh
cd /home/pm/LinuxNative/	# the directory of Linux Native Oberon
xterm -e ./oberon
cd -   

Name this script oberon, give it the execute permissions and put it to
/usr/local/bin/ . Now you can include this command in the menu as
described in the documentation of your desktop environment or window manager.

Send comments to matthias@ngi.de , especially if you know how to handle
a signal on stack overflow.
