Linux-based Native Oberon (LNO)

Please refer to install.txt for instructions on installing Linux-based
Native Oberon.

Linux Native Oberon is an emulation of Native Oberon on Linux. It works by
replacing a handful of low-level modules with implementations for Linux.
The interfaces of these modules are exactly the same as those of Native
Oberon, so the rest of the Native Oberon modules are loaded unchanged on
this base. Any modules you write are also binary compabile with Native
Oberon. You can even set up Linux Native and real Native to boot
interchangably from the same disk partition.

Linux Native was made by Peter Matthias (espi@epost.de).
