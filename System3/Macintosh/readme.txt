MacOberon System 3 Release 2.3
------------------------------

This is the official release of Oberon System 3 Release 2.3
for Macintosh. It has been developped by the ETH Institute
for Computersystems and the UCI Department for Information and
Computer Science.

MacOberon System 3 runs both on customary 68k-based computers 
and on modern PowerPC RISC machines with native speed. 
For that purpose, we introduced a technique that we call 
SLIM BINARIES. Slim binaries are a form of object files that 
contain no object code at all, but a portable description of a 
module's contents that makes these files completely independent 
of the eventual target machine. Object code generation is carried 
out on-the-fly by the module loader (depending on the underlying 
hardware) and takes no longer than loading traditional object files!
This release of MacOberon also includes the Juice Authoring Tool.
