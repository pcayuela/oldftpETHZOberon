\subsection{Editorial}

\textsc{Johannes L. Marais}

Everything that happens three times becomes tradition and will repeat itself again. Consequently this
third issue of the newsletter predicts a bright Oberon future --- and if we look at the
number of contributions in this issue in contrast to the previous newsletters, an ever
growing one too. We would like to thank all the authors who took time to write a contribution.

I would like to point out two ``must read'' articles in this issue (with no offense to the other authors
intended). The first is a report on {\em Joint Modular Languages} conference held in Germany by Peter~Schulthess.
If you are interested in Oberon, the conference proceedings are definitely something to have. The
other article that promises to revolutionize the Oberon world is titled {\em The Oberon
Module Interchange} by Michael Franz.
Happy reading!

\subsection{The Joint Modular Languages Conference}

\textsc{Peter Schulthess}, Department of Distributed Systems, Ulm.

From the 28th to the 30th September the Joint Modular Languages Conference 
1994 was organized at the University of Ulm, Germany. The tradition of the conference 
goes back to earlier conferences on Modula-2 in 1989, 90, 91, 92.  The 
traditional theme of the conference was extended to provide a comprehensive 
perspective of the current programming language scene. The scope of the 
selected papers included contributions on the use of Oberon, Modula-2, Modula-3, C++,
Ada, Eiffel, Beta, and other languages.  However, following the 
tradition and the subtitle of the conference (``Modula-2, Oberon and Friends'') 
many of the contributions centered on the Oberon Language. Commercial 
products of relevance to the conference topic were presented at a product 
exhibition during the event. Compilers and programming environments for Unix, 
MS-DOS,  Macintosh and DEC-Stations attracted considerable interest by the 
visitors. Tutorials preceding the conference offered the opportunity to the 
participants to familiarize themselves with C++ or Oberon. Tutorials and 
conference were attended by approximately 170 participants.

The keynote presentation entitled ``A Brief History of Modula and Lilith'' was 
given by Prof. Niklaus Wirth. The gradual progress of modular languages and 
the concurrent design of the Lilith computer was described. Object-oriented 
paradigms were later added to the original module concepts and led to the 
design of the Oberon Language and Oberon Systems. Professor Wirth's 
fascinating tour through the history of modular languages and into the 
imminent future of object-oriented languages has indeed set the stage for a 
large number of interesting presentations during the conference. 

Important topics of the conference sessions were Object-Oriented Development 
Tools and Techniques, Language Design \& Implementation Projects, Realtime 
Programming and Large Software Systems. Particular attention was paid to 
different concepts of inheritance. The question of single versus multiple 
inheritance was extensively discussed and several innovative schemes for 
restricted and partial inheritance were put forward. Attention appears to 
have shifted from the \mbox{Modula-2} language to Oberon and a large number of 
implementations on different hardware and operating system platforms were 
reported. Successful usage of \mbox{Modula-2} and Oberon in real-time programming 
projects was reported but it is highly desirable  that future conferences 
should solicit even more actively contributions from ``real programming 
language users''.

A significant group  of  programmers has adopted the language as a tool to 
write typesafe and efficient application programs within existing operating 
systems, but they refuse to work with the Oberon system interface. Typically, 
however, it was recognized that the Gadgets system now provides an 
alternative user interface to the earlier rather frugal  Oberon user 
interface. Gadgets was demonstrated to provide unrivalled flexibility in 
extensible graphical user interfaces.  In addition to Oberon implementations 
on existing Unix, MS-DOS, VMS, or Macintosh operating systems, native Oberon 
systems are emerging which are directly based on a relevant hardware 
platform. Experimental distributed Oberon systems might soon provide a mode 
of lean distributed processing which will fit seamlessly into existing 
network environments. 

Two panel discussions were held --- the first one on Modula-2  standardisation 
and the second on standardisation of Oberon. The history of \mbox{Modula-2}
standardisation was reported and lessons were learned how not to standardize 
a language. The activity of standardisation must be kept separate from the 
actual design process and members of a standards committee should refrain 
from redesigning and extending the language. The issue whether an ISO 
standard for Oberon would be needed was not resolved. Oberon documentation 
from ETH was recommended as a de facto standards document.

The JMLC Õ94 conference has clearly demonstrated that language design is 
still an active area of research and it is expected that the next Joint 
Modular Languages Conference will again offer reports on scientific progress 
and case studies on object-oriented and modular language usage in business 
and industrial applications. This conference is likely to be organized in 
spring 1996 at the University of  Linz in Austria. The proceedings of the 
JMLC Õ94 conference can be ordered from Universitaetsverlag Ulm GmbH, P.O.Box 
4204, D-89032 Ulm for DM 90 plus mailing.

\subsection{Oberon Day '94}

\textsc{Erich Oswald}, The Oberon User Group.

More than two hundred participants attended the Oberon Day '94 on 14th September in the Auditorium Maximum
at ETH Zurich. After the big success last year, the Oberon User Group  in cooperation with the Institute for Computer
Systems had decided to organize a second edition of the event.

This year's theme was titled ``New Ways in Computer Science Education''and was specifically addressed to teachers
of computer science. The organizers were very pleased with the high number of attendees which suggested the theme
had appealed to a lot of other people as well.

Talk topics included introductions to Oberon programming and Oberon concepts, case studies of Oberon usage for teaching
and Oberon product announcements. Among the speakers were several persons well known to the Oberon community like
Prof.~J.~Gutknecht, Dr.~M.~Reiser, and Dr.~J.~Templ.

The Oberon User Group is planning to organise further events in the future which will be announced in the
Oberon News.

\subsection{The Oberon Module Interchange (OMI)}

\textsc{Michael Franz}, Institute for Computer Systems.

``That's a program for the Macintosh, it will not run on my PC'' --- It has been fifteen years since the arrival of the personal 
computer, and by now even technical laymen understand that there are different kinds of computer, which require 
different kinds of software. Although this diversity adds huge costs to software development and distribution, it is generally 
accepted as an unalterable fact of life.

The OMI project attempts nothing less than to change this long-established view. It introduces the concept of a 
``portable object file'' that can be used on more than one kind of target machine. The mechanism behind OMI is 
completely transparent to the user; there are no converter programs to be run or installation procedures to be 
executed before a portable object file can be used on another machine participating in OMI. From the user's viewpoint, 
the only difference between ``portable'' object files and ``regular'' ones is that the former are usable on a wider 
range of machines than the latter.

\paragraph{Well Then, How Does It Work?}

It should of course be obvious that ``portable object files'' cannot contain ``real'' object code. Instead, they contain an 
\emph{abstract program description} using a clever encoding that later permits the fast generation of appropriate native
code for the eventual target machine, which in OMI happens during \emph{loading}. Since OMI is integrated into the
Oberon system, in which modules can be loaded dynamically at any time during a computing session, this means
that OMI can incrementally compile parts of a software system while other parts are already running. For
example, when the user (or a program) invokes a command from a ``portable'' module that has not yet been
loaded, OMI kicks in, compiles the module on-the-fly, executes the newly created body of the module, and
returns to the command handler that will then jump to the new command.

On-the-fly code generation at load time would be useless if it were too slow, thereby inconveniencing interactive users,
or if it produced bad code. Luckily, it seems that both of these problems have been solved in OMI. In its first
implementation, OMI is able to compile-and-load ``portable object files'' in about the same time that would
be required for reading equivalent ``regular'' object files from disk. The reason for this
is that ``portable object files'' are much smaller than their native counterparts, while program loading time is
dominated by I/O overhead. Since processor performance is rising more quickly than storage speeds, it is even
highly probable that on-the-fly code generation will outperform loading
of ``traditional'' object files in the long run.

\paragraph{Sounds Good In Theory. What About Practice?}

OMI is an ongoing research project at ETH's Institute for Computer Systems, building on the dissertation work
 of the author. At present, OMI is available only for MC680x0-based Macintoshes, but several additional platforms
  will be supported in the near future.
  
There are several reasons for releasing OMI already at this time, even before there are further implementations 
that would make it more useful. First of all, it is hoped that the existing implementation will convince even 
hard-line sceptics that the ideas behind OMI are sound. Secondly, OMI should provide the outside world with 
an idea of where future versions of the Oberon system are headed. Thirdly, the existence of OMI is likely to 
benefit the cause of spreading Oberon, so that publicising it early on might prevent some not-so-easily-reversable 
decisions in favor of other systems. And finally, it is impossible to debug a complex system without any user feedback. 
Hopefully, many people will experiment with OMI, comment on it and provide error reports, so that OMI will 
reach ``industrial strength'' by the time further implementations are ready.

Most importantly, there will be an implementation of OMI for the Apple PowerMacintosh in early 1995, which 
will form the core of a new MacOberon release that will run \emph{in native mode} both on MC680x0 processors and 
on PowerPC processors. Hence, as far as users are concerned, ETH will continue to supply only a single MacOberon 
system, but in the future, this system will provide native performance on both of Apple's hardware platforms. This 
may not sound so extraordinary, as there are already some commercial applications for the Apple Macintosh that 
run in native mode on either kind of Macintosh, but behind the scenes, the OMI approach is truly revolutionary.
  
Up until now, the problem of allowing programs to run on more than one kind of machine has been solved by 
what is called \emph{fat binaries}. This means that there are actually several executable versions of a program within 
a single ``application program file'', one for each type of target processor, and the system chooses at startup 
which part of the file is used. Of course, using ``fat binaries'' also means that programs grow to several times 
their original size. For example, applications that run on both kinds of Macintosh are usually even more than 
twice as big as their identical MC680x0-only counterparts, owing to the fact that the PowerPC has a lower code 
density than the MC680x0.
Using OMI technology, the future MacOberon will be able to provide \emph{slim binaries}. Readers who download the 
present release of OMI from our server and study it will find that OMI's ``portable object files'' are actually quite a 
lot smaller than the corresponding MC680x0 object files. Nevertheless, they are capable of replacing the native 
object files for both kinds of Macintosh systems simultaneously. Since most of the Oberon system can be represented 
as portable code, the future MacOberon will not grow larger than the present one, although Oberon's core 
modules and OMI itself will need to be present in ``fat binary'' format.
Eventually, OMI-interchangeability will be extended to further Oberon implementations. In fact, some projects 
are already under way. Programmers will then be able to release their modules for use by the whole OMI 
community, but without having to publish the source code. This will bring us one step closer to the old 
dream of ``software components'' that might yet revolutionize the discipline of software engineering.

\paragraph{To Probe Further}

OMI is now an optional part of ETH's MacOberon distribution. Optional means that, for the time being, modules 
are provided both in native and in OMI formats. Users on sufficiently powerful (i.e., MC68040) machines 
should not notice any difference when using the OMI-encoded modules, except for much smaller object 
files. On older Macintoshes, the performance balance between CPU and I/O is less to the advantage of 
on-the-fly code generation, and users of OMI will experience longer loading times (but no change in performance).
 
The technical details behind what has now become OMI are described in the author's doctoral dissertation.

\subsection{The Hybrid Project}

\textsc{Pieter Muller, Johan de Villiers, de Villiers de Wet, Jaco Geldenhuys}, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa.

The Hybrid group at the Computer Science department of the University of
Stellenbosch is primarily interested in reactive systems --- protocols,
operating systems and dedicated control systems.  We have developed a
kernel to support distributed client-server applications.

The Hybrid kernel is small, stable, efficient and flexible.  It supports
multiple virtual machines, which are protected address spaces containing
several light weight processes.  A virtual machine supports the
non-privileged instructions of the underlying machine (Intel 386), plus
three additional instructions for interprocess communication.  These
instructions are implemented as traps to the kernel and provide synchronous
rendez-vous message passing.  The kernel runs on a bare 386 in 32-bit
protected mode.  Messages to VMs on remote machines are transparently
delivered by the kernel via Ethernet.  This facilitates the construction of
flexible distributed systems.

The kernel is in everyday use in a number of factories where it supports a
production management system.  The system consists of a number of
microprocessor-based computing nodes interconnected via Ethernet and
running the Hybrid kernel.  It communicates to industry standard platforms
such as Novell, Unix and Windows via a TCP/IP server running in a VM.

An experimental distributed computing environment based on the kernel has
been developed.  This system supports teams of virtual machines
working together to solve a single problem.  An interactive factory
scheduling system is under development to enable factory operators to
manipulate the order in which jobs are selected to optimize throughput or
other important parameters.

The kernel consists of about 16,000 lines of Modula-2 code (including the
Ethernet drivers, IP and VMTP protocols).  A further 170,000 lines of
device drivers, servers and application programs have been developed.  All
the code was cross-developed on a Unix system using the MCS compiler.  The
system is maintained by graduate students and a staff member, who is also
responsible for the factory applications.

\paragraph{Oberon on the Hybrid Kernel}

During 1993, Oberon System 3 was ported to run in a VM on the Hybrid
kernel.  Hybrid Oberon can be placed in full control by running it as a
single VM on the kernel, or it can co-exist with the existing Hybrid window
server.  The Gadgets system and several applications from ETH were also
recompiled to run on Hybrid Oberon.

The facilities provided by Hybrid make it possible to do background
processing in a separate VM (possibly on another machine), thereby
achieving true multitasking.  The Oberon System was extended to support the
transparent invocation of remote services.

At the implementation level, multiple light weight processes were used to
marry the polling loop of Oberon with the synchronous message passing
supported by Hybrid.  In order to improve efficiency in a multitasking
system, the Oberon loop was altered to block when it is idle.

The starting point of the porting exercise was the DOS Oberon System, which
meant that the compiler could be used unchanged.  However, the inner core
of DOS Oberon was restructured by removing the Loader module and statically
linking the Kernel, Modules, FileDir and Files modules.  A full-featured
static linker was developed for this purpose.

We have experimented with several file systems for Oberon.  Our first file
system uses a Unix machine to store the files.  The Files module forwards
requests to a Unix process via the TCP/IP server.  This file system allows
us to use our existing diskless PCs and also allows file sharing with the
Unix system.  Unfortunately it is somewhat inefficient.  Our most efficient
file system is the one from Project Oberon, with some caching added.
However, this file system can not be used on diskless PCs.  A central
network file system based on the Project Oberon code is under development
as a student project.

\paragraph{Hybrid: Switching to Oberon}

The success of the Hybrid Oberon port prompted us to switch to the Oberon
language for all our programming.  During 1994 the Hybrid kernel was
re-implemented in the Oberon language.  The basic design has stayed the
same and the new kernel (now called Gneiss) can execute VMs written for the
old kernel, without recompilation.

Implementation of the Gneiss kernel is sufficiently advanced that it
supports the Hybrid Oberon system using the Project Oberon file system on a
local hard disk.  The new kernel is smaller and faster than the Modula-2
based kernel, even though the compilers generate code of comparable
efficiency.  This can be attributed to several factors.  The new kernel was
implemented by a single person over a period of a few months, whereas
several people have worked on the old kernel over a period of four years.
The experience gained in the implementation of the old kernel helped to
make the new one more efficient.  New techniques, e.g.\ continuations, were
used in the implementation of the new kernel.

During a visit to ETH in October the Gneiss kernel author used code from
the kernel and the Hybrid Oberon system to create a prototype of an Oberon
system running natively on a PC.  Work is continuing to develop device
drivers to be used for Gneiss and native Oberon.

\paragraph{Using Oberon for Embedded Systems}

The current academic focus of the Hybrid group is the development of
reliable embedded system software.  Testing is not a sufficiently powerful
method to develop highly reliable systems.  For such systems it is
necessary to build a validation model of the design that can be proved to
conform to the intentions of the designer.

We have developed a validation tool --- a model checker --- that can be used
to detect errors in system designs.  A modelling language was developed to
allow high-level models of reactive systems to be expressed concisely.  The
model checker checks the system model against system specifications written
in a formal logic syntax.  A model stepper tool is used to gain insight
into errors found by the model checker.  A code generator is being
developed to translate a correct model into an executable code skeleton
which captures the control-flow of the application.  These tools form
a verification workbench running on Oberon.

Although the model checker allows one to generate correct control-flow
skeletons, the Oberon code that is hand-written to flesh out the
skeletons may also contain errors.  In embedded systems, errors may
also be caused by the peripheral hardware.  To find these kinds of
errors, there is no replacement for testing an embedded system in-place.

For this purpose, a remote debugger for embedded applications is under
development.  The first prototype supports post-mortem analysis, as well as
interactive debugging via breakpoints and stepping.  Oberon modules are
linked into an executable image which is loaded into a VM on any Hybrid
machine.  The debugger communicates with the kernel on the target machine
to monitor and control the debugged application.

Source and assembly level debugging is supported.  Code breakpoints can
be set and machine instructions can be stepped one at a time.  A small
modification was made to the Oberon compiler to generate a mapping
between Oberon statements and machine addresses.

The user can view the stack (active procedures and local variables),
global variables and registers at any stage.  A useful feature of the
debugger is that pointers can be dereferenced.  Symbolic dereferencing
cannot be done, but a hexadecimal dump of the memory is given, and if
it is a record containing pointers, they are marked and can in turn be
followed.

Currently work is being done to support the same debugging interface
over a serial link, for debugging stand-alone embedded applications.

\subsection{PC-Oberon: A Progress Report}

\textsc{F. Arickx, J. Broeckhove, T. Van den Eede, L. Vinck}, Onderzoeksgroep Toegepaste
Informatica, Universiteit Antwerpen (RUCA), Belgium.

As introduced at the JMLC conference, held last September at the University of
Ulm (Germany), PC-Oberon represents a native port of the Oberon operating
system to the PC compatible hardware platform, featuring i80386 processors or
above. PC-Oberon provides a full 32-bit version of the Oberon OS, based on a
custom 32-bit kernel, running in i80386 protected mode.

The whole porting project consists of several subtasks: (1) implementation of
the (real mode) master bootrecord code, including management of the hard disk
partitioning capabilities; (2) implementation of logical (partition based)
bootrecord code, preparing the processor to run in protected mode, switching
the processor in this protected mode, loading the 32-bit kernel and
transferring control to the Oberon boot code; (3) implementation of a 32-bit
reentrant kernel, providing a software interface to the hardware components;
(4) implementation of 32-bit Oberon boot code transferring control to the
proper Oberon operating system code.

The bootrecord codes, master as well as logical, were written, compiled and
linked on a DOS system, using Borland C and Turbo assembler. The 32-bit kernel
contains a functional interface for access to floppy and IDE hard disk,
keyboard, serial and parallel ports, sound system, memory management,
real-time clock, etc. This 32-bit code is written in C and assembler, also
using Borland's 32-bit code generating compilers and linker. The kernel is
functional and was low-level tested by specific routines for each hardware
component; the test programs are temporarily included in the kernel and can be
invoked at boot time. High-level testing occurs (will occur) from the Oberon
system.

The Oberon interface to the kernel consists of a single software interrupt.
One of the parameters is always, as we call it, the invoke number, identifying
the desired kernel function. All required parameters for the kernel function,
including the invoke number, are pushed on the stack before issuing the
software interrupt. This allows for reentrancy of the kernel. For efficiency
reasons, the kernel calls are coded using inline assembly, and are
concentrated in a single Oberon module Invoke.Mod.

The Oberon system used as a starting point in this project is DOS-Oberon
System 3 Version 1.5. This choice was mainly made because DOS-Oberon is based
on a 32-bit i80386 code generating Oberon compiler. All real mode system calls
to BIOS and DOS were removed from DOS-Oberon and replaced, where possible, by
the 32-bit kernel calls. The original Ceres oriented filesystem modules were
used to replace the DOS file interface.

The current status of the system is that PC-Oberon correctly accomplishes its
boot sequence, and we are currently eliminating bugs from the kernel. We
expect to have a fully operational version of PC-Oberon in the near future.
This will however not be the end of this project. The current kernel will be
extended to provide additional hardware support, in particular network
functionality. Support within the kernel, for additional operating system
features such as e.g.\ ``active objects'' will be considered.

Progress of the project may be monitored at any time through the World Wide
Web at URL {\tt http://www.ruca.ua.ac.be/Memex/Oberon}.

\subsection{Dynamic Online Documents in Oberon}

\textsc{Ralph Sommerer}, Institute for Computer Systems.

Dynamic online documents provide a unified abstract model for interactive information services. Their most
important properties compared 
to ``ordinary'' documents are their non-locality (online documents may be distributed over several locations) and 
the lack of a static global state (online documents or parts of it may be computed at the time of their access
 i.e.\ ``on the fly''). Two variants of such dynamic online documents have recently been integrated into the Oberon system.

{\em TeleNews} is an online document that presents itself as an electronic newspaper. Its content is generated, 
maintained and updated by a {\em Teletext} server (Teletext is a page-oriented information service that is broadcast 
together with the television video signal). TeleNews allows clients to interactively access and obtain news 
articles from the Teletext service in hypertext form. An {\em electronic TV guide} as part of the electronic newspaper 
allows excerpts of a television program list (program {\em projections}) to be constructed depending on, for example, 
a range of broadcast time or the type of the program. The last page of the newsletter shows a display snapshot of
the TeleNews panel.

{\em World-Wide Web} (WWW) is a network information service that is structured as a global hypertext document whose 
pages contain reference links that allow to switch context to logically related items (further hypertext documents, 
but also images, video sequences and sound patterns). These items may be physically located at very different 
locations in the world. The definition of the World-Wide Web consists of a network protocol (HTTP, hypertext 
transfer protocol) and a markup notation for hypertext documents (HTML, hypertext markup language).
World-Wide Web can be viewed as an online document whose parts are accessed via network. Its integration 
into the Oberon system bases on an almost complete implementation of the current HTML definition, including, 
since recently, also fill-out forms. On the last page of the newsletter you see a snapshot of the WWW panel.

Although both services have different semantics and accessing schemes, they are integrated into the Oberon 
system based on a unified user interface model which centralizes all service specific aspects within a single 
concept called {\em active hypertext link} (or {\em active link} for short).

\subsection{News around Oberon System 3 and Gadgets}

\nopagebreak[4]
\textsc{Johannes L. Marais}, Institute for Computer Systems.

\nopagebreak[4]
Oberon System 3 is an important research project at the Institute
for Computer Systems to improve the Oberon system
and its use. The system has turned out to be a successful platform for experimentation
with new ideas in system design and user interfaces. It has spawned a number
of research projects at the Institute for Computer Systems and other institutes at ETH.

Oberon System 3 and Gadgets have experienced a remarkable dynamic development. Positive developments
are continually being incorporated into the system so that it is consistently improving in quality and functionality.
Currently we are entering another
consolidation phase based on the experiences we made in the last two years. This is mainly
to rectify two things. First, we found that some configurability we built in from the start
was seldomly used, and can now be replaced with new and unified concepts that we developed
later on. Secondly, from experience gained from projects outside the institute, some gadgets,
notably the panels, have been redesigned for increased extensibility. Perhaps the most important, the
Oberon System 3 documentation project with electronic books is gaining momentum. To allay the fears
of those thinking we are changing everything again, I can assure users that we are very concerned about
compatibility.

In addition to preparing the release 1.6 of Oberon System 3, we are also looking towards the future
--- we hope to deliver these ideas in future versions. The two research directions involve connecting
Oberon to the world of electronic services, and to extend the Oberon System with concurrency in
the form of ``active objects''. The first of which is progressing well, as you will see on the display snapshot
at the end of the newsletter. If all goes well you may expect release 1.6 of Oberon System~3 around
the beginning of next year.

\subsection{TCP/IP for MacOberon and PowerMac Oberon}

\textsc{Daniel Scherer}, TIK, ETH Zurich.

Implementations of TCP/IP are now available both for MacOberon and for
PowerMac Oberon; they also work with both Oberon V4 and Oberon System
3. TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is
a widely used standard for connecting computers over any distance and
running many different operating systems. Therefore it is now possible to
do worldwide communication from a Macintosh using an Oberon System.

Our implementations of TCP map the Oberon TCP procedures to calls of
Apple's MacTCP driver. While at first sight this might seem trivial, it was
rather tricky as MacTCP does not provide all services in the way required
by the Oberon definition and also due to large numbers of parameters in
MacTCP calls which required the consultation of the original paper defining
TCP. Particular care has also been taken to ensure that TCP does not block
an application if e.g.\ a communication partner does not respond. Therefore,
most MacTCP calls are executed asynchronously and resources used by a
MacTCP call are not released until its asynchronous completion.
Furthermore, our implementations also provide finalization of connections
(as specified by the definition) which signifies that TCP connections no
longer used are automatically closed. A possible scenario in a TCP
application is that a user closes a window displaying a TCP connection
without first disconnecting. If the user thereby loses all references to
that connection, TCP automatically closes it.

All the asynchronous operations are hidden by the simple synchronous
interface. It provides ways to establish connections for both clients and
servers including translation of host names to IP addresses as well as
synchronous read and write procedures for various data types. These
services may be used by application modules to implement specific
communication protocols, e.g.\ for file transfer based on TCP. A TCP
application normally also contains some asynchronous parts, e.g.\ by using
an Oberon task to poll for the availability of data before using a blocking
read operation.

At TIK, we plan to use TCP for communication in a distributed environment
to be implemented on Oberon Systems running on \mbox{(Power-)} Macintosh
computers. So far, we have implemented some basic application modules using
TCP such as file transfer and message exchange among users. Our TCP
implementations have been used successfully at TIK for several months
already and currently contain no known bugs. They are available through
anonymous ftp from {\tt rudolf.ethz.ch}, directory {\tt /pub/Oberon}, and feedback to
{\tt scherer@tik.ee.ethz.ch} is appreciated.

\subsection{DART-Oberon}

\textsc{Libero Nigro}, DEIS, Universita' della Calabria, Italy and \textsc{Brian Kirk}, Robinson Associates, UK.

DART --- Distributed Architecture for Real Time --- represents an ongoing project aimed 
at supporting the development of Real Time systems using Oberon-2 or C++ as the 
implementation language. DART is centred on the concept of light-weight operating 
software: its mechanisms are not extensions of built-in OS mechanisms, rather they 
refer to active objects, i.e.\ instances of abstract data types. Active objects are modeled 
as finite state machines which communicate one with another by asynchronous 
message passing. Messages are transparently captured and managed by a scheduler 
object which imposes a dispatching policy which can be tuned to the application needs. 
In an object, message reception is implicit. The arrival of a message triggers a state 
transition and then the execution of an atomic action. Action execution extends the 
thread of control of the scheduler. The runtime model is non-preemptive. Action 
granularity can be fine-grained in order to guarantee real time constraints to be met.
An overall system is organised as a collection of subsystems. Each subsystem 
corresponds to an application domain, and thus to a particular set of aspects of the 
system. Objects belonging to different subsystems are allowed to communicate using a 
system-wide non-blocking send, which relies on a heterogeneous message format. As 
a matter of simplification, a subsystem can admit a special object named a coordinator 
which is the target of inter-subsystem communications and delegates sub-tasks to 
hidden objects of the subsystem.
DART programming in the small is conveniently supported by Oberon-2 or C++. The 
project addresses interoperability: a major goal is supporting mixed platforms and 
implementations. Subsystems programmed in C++ can interact with Oberon-2 
subsystems and vice versa. A prototype implementation of DART has been achieved 
on a PC network under Novell provision of AT\&T TLI (Transport Layer Interface). 
DOS and Windows platforms can be used in combination. User interface issues can be 
dealt with on a Windows platform where the Robinson's Oberon-2/386 compiler and 
POW! environment are used. On a DOS platform the Extacy Oberon package is used. 
More information on DART can be found in JMLC '94 proceedings.

\subsection{Logic Magicians' Oberon}

\textsc{Taylor Hutt}, Logic Magician, USA.

When compared to other languages and operating systems on a PC, using
Oberon is undoubtedly a pleasurable experience for you.  Yet, despite
the advantages which Oberon brings into the realm of programming, you
still want more.  You secretly desire a single system which runs
under DOS, Windows, \& OS/2 using a 2 or 3 button mouse and places no
special constraints on your system configuration.  Just in case
someone happens to be listening to your secret fantasies, you quickly
add that you want to have an Oberon-2 compiler, source code for most
of the system and Postscript documentation for undocumented parts of
Oberon.  FREE.

Perhaps someone has been listening to your thoughts, because the
Logic Magicians' Oberon System V2, complete with garbage collection,
is now available as freeware. Sporting an \mbox{Oberon-2} compiler which allows 96Kb of code and 128Kb of
constants/data per module, this system relies on the industry
standard DPMI (DOS Protected Mode Interface) specification to provide
a 32bit, protected mode, flat memory model environment.  Special care
has been taken during the porting of this system to limit the impact
on your system configuration; to that extent, we have been extremely
successful: there are no special requirements for CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT and both 2 and 3 button Microsoft compatible mice are
supported.  A standard VGA is required for 640x480x16, but an ET4000
chipset is supported at 1024x768x256 (more display drivers are
planned).

Not surprisingly, several advantages are realized because a DPMI
server has been used as the base for the DOS extender.  First of all,
the system is portable to any DPMI v0.90+ server.  Secondly, the
amount of heap space is only limited by the DPMI server --- the
minimum is 2Mb and the maximum is 32Mb.  Thirdly, and most
importantly, differences in low-level hardware are masked by the DPMI
server, thus allowing greater compatibility with various machines.

In an effort to increase the usage and understanding of Oberon,
virtually all the source code to the operating system is available
for this package.  Further, Postscript documentation has been made
available for many previously undocumented aspects of the V2 Oberon
system, plus a complete description on how to write display drivers.
Standard printing of Oberon source and documents can be achieved if a
Postscript or HP laser printer is connected to the parallel port. 
An auto-import feature has been designed to make it easy to include
new software into an installed Oberon system.  It works transparently
and does not require intervention on the part of the user.

You may get this Oberon implementation from
{\tt ftp.clark.net:\-/pub/thutt/distrib/V2}.  See the {\tt 00index} file for
instructions on which parts to download.  If you do not have access
to ftp, you may get the most recent copy on disk by sending a check
or money order for US \$3 to

\subsection{Integrating Multimedia on the workstation Ceres-2}

\textsc{Peter Ryser}, Institute for Computer Systems.

The workstation Ceres was designed and constructed in 1985. Its simple and efficient hardware interface gives a 
wide range of opportunities for hardware extensions. In 1993 we built an Ethernet card that allows for direct 
access to the services of the Internet, and in the spring of 1994, in his diploma thesis, a student built an audio- and video 
board (AVB).
The AVB allows to capture video from a video source such as a camera or a VCR. The quality of the captured video 
data ranges from 8 bit grey scale to 24 bit RGB. The audio channel samples and plays stereo data up to 48k samples 
at 16 bits per sample. The acquisition of audio and video data is interrupt driven and is handled completely in the 
background.
Watching TV at a resolution of 320x400 pixel  and a rate of 25 frames/s (the PAL frame rate) on the monitor of 
the Ceres workstation was a first step of integrating multimedia into Oberon.
A more sophisticated solution uses a client/server approach. The server, a Ceres workstation equipped with an 
AVB and an Ethernet card, broadcasts the captured audio and video data streams over the local subnet. The clients 
listen on a specific port, get the incoming data, display the video data on the screen and simultaneously play the 
audio data through an audio device.
The interface to the user on the client side is made through an extension of Oberon V4's text elements. These 
multimedia elements (MMElems) have the same properties as all the other text elements. Therefore, one can 
have one or several TV screens floating in a text. All MMElems are updated simultaneously at the arriving of a 
new frame.
``Video on demand'', a catchword not thought of when the Ceres workstation was designed ten years ago, 
becomes possible on this platform because of simple but powerful hard- and software.

{\em Moderne Programmierparadigmen ---
vom ``Structured Programming'' \"uber den objektorientierten Ansatz zum ``Extensible Programming''}. 
N. Wirth, M. Franz (Kursleitung), M. Brandis, S. Ludwig, J. Supcik

Die Entwicklung der Programmiersprachen ist gepr\"agt von der Entstehung immer m\"achtigerer
Abstraktionsmechanismen. Was einst bescheiden mit der Einf\"uhrung mnemonischer Codes
(f\"ur die Operationen) und Variablennamen (f\"ur die Operanden) begann, hat in der Zwischenzeit
wiederholt vollst\"andig neue Ans\"atze hervorgebracht, die nicht nur die eigentliche Programmierung,
sondern auch die Methodik des Software-Design grundlegend ver\"andert haben.

Mit der Schaffung der Programmiersprachen Pascal, Modula-2 und Oberon durch Professor
Niklaus Wirth ist die ETH Z\"urich an diesem Entwicklungsprozess seit langem mass\-geb\-lich beteiligt.
Jede dieser Sprachen repr\"asentiert einen Meilenstein in der Entstehungsgeschichte der
Programmierparadigmen: Pascal steht f\"ur ``Structured Programming'', Modula-2 f\"ur ``Modular
Programming'', und Oberon schliesslich f\"ur objektorientiertes und ``Extensible Programming'', wobei
jede dieser Sprachen die Konzepte ihrer jeweiligen Vorg\"anger nat\"urlich einschliesst.

Der Kurs vermittelt diejenigen Programmierparadigmen, die erst nach der Definition von Pascal vor
mehr als 25 Jahren entstanden sind, und die heute in Oberon wiederzufinden sind. Er folgt dabei in
drei Schritten der Evolution der Programmiersprachen, beginnend am ersten Kurstag mit den Konzepten
der strukturierten und modularen Programmierung. Der zweite Kurstag besch\"aftigt sich mit den Ideen
der objektorientierten Programmierung, w\"ahrend der dritte Tag schliesslich den erweiterbaren
Programmsystemen gewidmet ist.

Ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Kurses sind betreute \"Ubungen, in denen die Teilnehmer die M\"oglichkeit
haben, die gelernten Konzepte in kleinen Gruppen am Computer zu erproben. Als Basis f\"ur die \"Ubungen
wird die Pascal-Nachfolgesprache Oberon verwendet, weshalb eine gewisse Vertrautheit mit Pascal
oder einer Pascal-\"ahnlichen Sprache Voraussetzung f\"ur den Besuch dieses Kurses ist.

\subsection{Power Gadgets Available}

\nopagebreak[4]
\textsc{Andreas Wuertz}, TIK, ETH.

\nopagebreak[4]
By the time you read this, there should be a beta release of Oberon System 3
for Power Macintosh available on {\tt neptune.inf.ethz.ch}. Look in the directory
{\tt /pub/Oberon/System3/POWERMAC}.

Some features are:

\begin{itemize}

\item Up to 8 bit colour support on screen and pictures.

\item Colour/grayscale printing on all newer QuickDraw and PostScript printer
drivers.

\item Display3 and Printer3 optimised for Macintosh clipping architecture

\item Full Oberon-2 Compiler (same as Power V4, except it allows up to 127
imports)

\item Hierarchical file system  (same as Power V4)

\end{itemize}

There are still a few known bugs.
The colour model is not very stable yet. Specially when editing pictures with
Paint, the background color may unexpectedly change. Although the system is
based on PowerOberon 1.0 and MacOberon 4.1xx, it is still in beta state and
not tested for stability, so be careful!

Please send questions, comments and bug reports to:

\subsection{Action-Oberon}

\textsc{Eric Hedman}, {\AA}bo Akademi University,
Finland.

The department of computer science at {\AA}bo Akademi University has an active
programming methodology research group. One
of the groups research topics is {\em action systems}. An action
system is a model for specifying and reasoning about parallel
programs, based on Dijkstra's guarded command language. Lately, action
systems have been extended with modular constructs in [1].
{\em Action-Oberon} is an extension of both the Oberon system and
the Oberon language that incorporates action systems in Oberon
according to these principles.

In an action system the individual actions are atomic, but may be
interleaved arbitrarily, or executed in parallel if they do not share
any common variables. As such, the Oberon Loop can be considered an
action system, and is thus a good starting point for a scheduler of
actions. The extended Oberon Loop provides support for interacting
with the scheduling of actions. The actions, which by themselves are
guarded commands, are introduced at the module level of Action-Oberon,
making modules {\em active} at load-time. Parallel composition of
action systems is then modelled by two active modules loaded into
memory at the same time. While preserving the original semantics of
the Oberon Loop, this approach extends it with the parallel behaviour
of action systems.

At the language level only one extension is really needed, namely the
concept of guarded commands. Action-Oberon distinguishes between two
types of guarded commands, actions and guarded procedures. In the
action system model, guarded procedures can be used for modelling most
synchronisation and communication mechanisms.

Action-Oberon also includes an interactive environment for monitoring
the execution of action systems. One of the goals of Action-Oberon is
to provide a specification environment where fairly abstract action
systems can be executed and monitored. This has to some extent defined
the terms of the design and outweighed optimal performance in the
implementation.

Action-Oberon has been implemented in SPARC Oberon and will be
released to the public in the (hopefully) near future. The release
will be announced in the Usenet newsgroup {\tt comp.lang.oberon}.
For more information about the implementation contact

Methodology Group at {\AA}bo Akademi and its publications (including

\subsection{ONTIME}

\textsc{Karl Rege}, Institute for Computer Systems.

ONTIME is an acronym for an ``\textbf{O}bject Orie\textbf{n}ted Framework Assisting \textbf{T}ime and \textbf{I}nformation
\textbf{M}anagement of an \textbf{E}xecutive''. It is the realization of an advanced prototype Personal Digital Assistant
(PDA) based on Oberon System 3 and Gadgets (kernel) that co-design qualified the author of this article 
to exploit its features in an optimal way. We believe a PDA should not be merely a scaled down workstation
system but a system provided with new qualities in terms of integration and ease of use.
Consequently, the user interface follows mainly the direct manipulation user interaction paradigm.
Non-modality and simplicity were properties inherited from the original Oberon system. To achieve a
maximum level of integration, ONTIME is realized in an object-oriented manner, i.e.\ the system is
composed of advanced and versatile objects. The essence of such a system reveals in these objects
cooperative working ``hand in hand''. Specific functionalities of the ONTIME system include its
powerful time management realized both as weekly and monthly diary. Various diary
synchronizations are possible such as, for example, between different personal agendas to determine
possible meeting times (also over a network). The integrated electronic mail system examines
incoming mails and (optionally) inserts event announcements directly into the diary. To perform this
task a regular grammar matcher is included. The grammar may be specified in an augmented EBNF
notation. This grammar matcher is also applied to decompose arbitrarily formatted mail addresses
(according to national uses) into their components to be inserted into a (standard) relational
database. For the handling of text messages a textual data base (so called Archives) has been
integrated into the system. Applying a full text search algorithm (using PAT-arrays) allows arbitrary
queries to be performed in logarithmic time. Due to the homogeneous system architecture these
Archives may be used for texts and objects. Furthermore, Archives serve as interfaces for remote
access to such objects and hence allow to realize a system of distributed objects (comparable with
DSOM). Links to documents may be specified including also external references, for example, to
WWW-documents. For the spacial arrangement of the documents on the display a versatile non
overlapping display space organization of these documents has been realized, that unifies the Oberon
track model with a flexible application specific organization. Finally, there is support for ONTIME on pen
based portable computers due to an integrated gesture and handwriting
recognition [Xerox Unistrokes by Goldberg \& Richardson, INTERCHI 93, Conference on Human Factors in Computer Systems]. 

\subsection{Oberon V4 for the PowerMacintosh}

\textsc{H. M\"{o}ssenb\"{o}ck}, Johannes Kepler University, Linz.

The ETH Oberon System V4 has recently been ported to the PowerMacintosh
where it runs in native mode on a PowerPC processor. It supports the
hierarchical file system with user-definable search paths. Foreign language
procedures from shared libraries (DLLs) can be called from within Oberon.
Basic toolbox support is available; other toolbox interfaces can be
implemented on demand.
  The compiler supports Oberon-2 and generates native PowerPC code. It
compiles about 2000 lines per second on a 66 MHz PowerPC.
  The distribution contains also new tools and packages, such as a post
mortem debugger, a package for building and using graphical user
interfaces, a scanner/parser generator, and lots of new text elements. Most
of this new software is available in source code. See also the articles
about the debugger and the Dialogs package in this newsletter.
  PowerMac users with a one-button mouse can use a modified version of the
TextFrames module which allows pointing, selecting and scrolling with the
single mouse button (no modifier keys). This module also works with the
familiar Macintosh scroll bars.
  The system and its documentation can be obtained via anonymous ftp from
{\tt oberon.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at}, {\tt /pub/Oberon/PowerMac}. For further questions
contact {\tt moessenboeck@ssw.uni-linz.ac.at}.

\subsection{Post Mortem Debugger for Oberon V4}

\textsc{M. Hof}, Johannes Kepler University, Linz.

The original Oberon environment offered only limited means for inspecting
run time information and determining the reason of traps. Only variables of
basic types such as INTEGER or CHAR could be inspected.
  There is a new post mortem debugger which allows also the inspection of
structured types such as records, arrays, and pointers. It supports views
on local and global variables. Pointers can be followed in order to
traverse complex data structures on the heap. Run time types are supported
as well as open arrays. Additionally, the trap position in the source code
can be viewed.
  The new debugger is available for the PowerMac and the Windows version of
Oberon. It can be obtained via anonymous ftp as part of the respective
system from {\tt oberon.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at}, {\tt /pub/Oberon/PowerMac} or
{\tt /pub/Oberon/Windows}. The debugger sources are included in the PowerMac
version. Documentation is also included. For further questions contact
{\tt hof@ssw.uni-linz.ac.at}.

\subsection{Oberon Dialogs: A Graphical User Interface for Oberon V4}

\textsc{Markus Knasmueller}, Johannes Kepler University, Linz.

The Oberon System has a compact textual interface. This is convenient for
professional programmers, but not always for end users who prefer a
graphical interface.
  Therefore the \emph{Oberon Dialogs} package was implemented at the University
of Linz. This package allows a user to create and use dialog viewers with
buttons, checkboxes, text fields and other user interface items. Dialogs
fit smoothly into the Oberon system and should run under all (Oberon V4)
platforms without any changes in the system. Existing tools can be
augmented with a graphical user interface without having to be modified.
Because of the object-oriented nature of Dialogs, new user interface items
and new commands can be added by third party programmers.

  A similar package for graphical user interfaces is the Gadgets system
implemented for Oberon System 3. While the Gadgets system is more powerful
(e.g.\ nested objects) it is also more complex and does not run under
Oberon V4. The virtue of the Dialogs package is that it is
extremly light-weight and smoothly fits into Oberon V4.

  Working with dialogs is quite simple. There are commands to use, edit and
print a dialog. Dialogs can be displayed in two modes: {\em Dialog.Open} opens a
dialog for using it while {\em Dialog.Edit} opens it for editing.
  Dialogs can be created using an insert dialog (Figure \ref{dialogs}). This dialog
contains a list box which shows all items implemented so far.  The user
can select an item and insert it into a dialog viewer.  Items can be moved,
resized, deleted and copied with mouse clicks. It is even possible to
associate an item with a command, which is called whenever a property of
the item changes.

\begin{figure}
    \centerline{\psfig{figure=dialogs.eps,width=8cm}}
  \caption{Dialog for creating new dialog panels}
  \label{dialogs}
\end{figure}

Oberon Dialogs can be used and understood in a few minutes. Therefore we
believe that the Dialogs package is a good example for the flexibility of
Oberon and object-oriented programming. Try it and give us your comments
via e-mail.

  Oberon Dialogs (with full source code) can be obtained via ftp
({\tt Oberon.ssw.uni-linz.ac.at}, {\tt /pub/Dialogs}). Extensive documentation is
available. For questions or comments contact
{\tt knasmueller@ssw.uni-linz.ac.at}.

\subsection{Oberon/F: Introducing a New Oberon System}

\textsc{Cuno Pfister}, Oberon microsystems.

Oberon microsystems, Inc., Switzerland, announces a new Oberon system called {\em Oberon/F}.
Oberon/F will soon be available in versions for Windows 3.1 and for Mac OS 7.
Oberon/F applications can be ported from one platform to the other simply by
recompiling them, i.e.\ their application programming interfaces (APIs) are identical and
platform-independent. However, the correct native look-and-feel is provided on each
platform. Unlike the ETH Oberon systems, Oberon/F has no proprietary user interface.
The design of Oberon/F has been strongly influenced by the experience with earlier
Oberon systems like ETH Oberon System 3, V4, and Ethos, nevertheless it is a new design
not directly compatible with any of its predecessors. It is fully based on the language
Oberon-2.
An extensible text editor is part of the standard distribution of Oberon/F, as is a forms
editor and an integrated development environment. Documentation is available both
in printed form and on-line.
Oberon/F supports a compound document architecture which provides a seamless
migration path towards OLE and OpenDoc; these standards will be supported in a later
release.
An educational version of Oberon/F (not for commercial use) will become freely available
electronically, e.g.\ via anonymous ftp from
 {\tt hades.ethz.ch} (129.132.71.5)
 {\tt /pub/Oberon/NonETHSystems}.

\subsection{Statistics on a Voyage to Oberon}

\textsc{G. Sawitzki}, Universit\"at Heidelberg.

StatLab Heidelberg, the statistical laboratory at the Institut f\"ur
Angewandte Mathematik, Universit\"at Heidelberg, is developing a
statistical data analysis and simulation system based on Oberon. The system
provides an extensible base for classical statistics, but is focused on
what is known in the trade as ``interactive exploratory data analysis''. It
provides all the usual statistical interactive facilities like brushing in
linked windows, selection and identification, or rotating 3d scatterplots.
A first prototype has been demonstrated at the conference on computational
statistics CompStat, Vienna 1994. The CompStat report is available as a
postscript file by ftp or www from {\tt statlab.uni-heidelberg.de}.

As part of this project, a library of statistical algorithms in Oberon is
being build up and will be published on the same ftp/www site. If you need
special algorithms like distribution functions, quantiles or random number
generators now, you can contact me at
{\tt gs@statlab.uni--heidelberg.de}.

\subsection{Accessing The Internet By E-Mail}

\emph{The following text is copyrighted by ``Doctor Bob'' Rankin. Please read the 
copyright notice in the document refered to by this text.}

If your only access to the Internet is via e-mail, you don't have to
miss out on all the fun!  Maybe you've heard of FTP, Gopher, Archie,
Veronica, Finger, Whois, WAIS, World-Wide Web, and Usenet but thought
they were out of your reach because your online service does not provide
those tools.  Not so!  And even if you do have full Internet access,
using e-mail servers can save you time and money.

This special report will show you how to retrieve files from FTP sites,
explore the Internet via Gopher, search for information with Archie,
Veronica, or WAIS, tap into the World-Wide Web, and even access Usenet
newsgroups using E-MAIL AS YOUR ONLY TOOL.

If you can send a note to an Internet address, you're in the game!  This
is great news for users of online services where there is partial or no
direct Internet access.

I encourage you to read this entire document first and then go back and
try out the techniques that are covered.  This way, you will gain a
broader perspective of the information resources that are available, an
introduction to the tools you can work with, and the best methods for
finding the information you want.

This document is now available from an automated mail server.

\subsection{Oberon Source Code}

\textsc{Stefan Ludwig}, Institute for Computer Systems.

If you login on our ftp-server {\tt ftp.inf.ethz.ch} (also known as
{\tt neptune.inf.ethz.ch}, 129.132.101.33), you will find many interesting programs
in the {\tt /pub/Oberon/Tools} directory. Among them are an extended text-editor for
the Oberon V4 system, called \emph{XE}, which features convenient enhancements for
programmers. For instance, text-selection works incrementally: Subsequent
clicks on the same location select a character, a word, a name (e.g.\ \emph{a.b.c}),
and a whole line. Also, you can middle-click at a selected text, interclicking
the left key in the target viewer, and thereby moving the text stretch to
another location (drag and drop). A flexible compile command lets you compile
programs containing folded texts, and you can append a command and options
overriding standard options to the compile command (e.g.\ \emph{Analyzer.Analyze}
instead of \emph{Compiler.Compile}). Error elements showing possible errors are
inserted into the text automatically.
  By middle-right clicking at a text stretch, the command \emph{Doc.Open} is called
with the clicked-at text as an argument. This way, you can open any kind of
document according to its extension with an installed command (e.g.\ for
\emph{*.Text} \emph{XE.Open} may be called, for \emph{*.Graph} \emph{Draw.Open}, etc.). \emph{Doc} is
also in that directory among other programs, such as \emph{AsciiCoder},
\emph{CaptionEdit}, \emph{Find}, \emph{Folds}, \emph{LineSorter}, and \emph{Macro}.

\subsection{Programmieren in Oberon --- Das neue Pascal}

The German edition of \emph{Programming in Oberon --- Steps beyond Pascal and Modula-2}
by N. Wirth and M. Reiser is available from Addison-Wesley as
\emph{Programmieren in Oberon --- Das neue Pascal}.
The German edition has been prepared by Josef Templ, a native German speaker with 5
years of experience in teaching and using Oberon at ETH Zurich.
ISBN 3-89319-657-9, hard cover, 330 pages, DM 69,90 incl.\ tax.
Discounts up to 35\% have been reported for ordering more than 200 pieces.

In addition to the Oberon book, Addison-Wesley offers an Oberon CD-ROM,
which contains all ETH-Oberon implementations, a number of example programs
in source form, demo versions of commercial Oberon products and --- due to the lack
of German documentation --- a German introduction into using the Oberon system.
Since all ETH-Oberon distributions contain installation guidelines and online
documentation in English, the CD-ROM will also serve the needs of the
English speaking reader.
ISBN 3-89319-791-5, DM ~ 69,90 incl.\ tax.

%\subsection{Oberon Tutorial at OOPSLA'94}
%
%\textsc{Josef Templ}

%A tutorial about object-oriented programming in Oberon was given by Josef Templ and Wolfgang Pree (SIEMENS, Munich)
%at the OOPSLA'94 conference in Portland, Oregon. OOPSLA is the most prestigeous conference on OO-programming 
%and was attended by as many as 3200 persons. The program featured many language tutorials in parallel 
%(including Modula-3, Beta, Smalltalk, Self etc.) but the Oberon tutorial was among the most popular ones.
%The accompanying exhibition showed the newest alpha and beta releases of commercial OO-software products 
%(e.g. Taligent, OpenDoc). Unfortunately, there was no Oberon product to see but one got the impression that
%System 3 with Gadgets could outperform these monster pieces easily.

The \emph{Compress} package\footnote{This package is not compatible with the UNIX utility with the same name.} from
Emil Zeller allows you to compress Oberon files into a single archive.
The resulting archive is useful for the distribution of Oberon files as the longer Oberon filenames are stored
inside of the archive. The Compress source code is portable between V4 and System 3 on all Oberon ports and can be
obtained from {\tt hades.ethz.ch} in the {\tt /pub/Oberon/Sources} directory.

Alan Freed has released a basic Oberon Math library for REALs and LONGREALs (sqrt, sin, cos, cot etc). It is based
on the existing Math modules of Oberon with an interface providing error messages for exceptional conditions. It can be downloaded
as the files {\tt Maths.Mod} and {\tt MathsL.Mod} from the ftp server {\tt hades.ethz.ch}. Alan can be
contacted at {\tt al@sarah.lerc.nasa.gov}.

\subsection{Literature}

Several books have been written about the Oberon System and Language. We recommend these books for
serious Oberon users. However, if you want to try out Oberon before buying a book, most Oberon
releases have enough online information to get a new user started with Oberon.

\subsection{How to get Oberon}

Oberon is available free of charge from our Internet FTP server {\tt ftp.inf.ethz.ch} in
the {\tt /pub/Oberon} directory. The sub-directory {\tt System3} contains the Oberon System 3 versions. Oberon V4 is
available for Amiga, DECStation, MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows and Windows NT, HP 700, Mac II, IBM RS6000, SPARC
and Silicon Graphics machines. Oberon System 3 Version 1.5 is currently only available for MS-DOS, Linux, and SPARC computers. 
If you do not have access to Internet, you can order diskettes from the address below. We charge a fee of Sfr 50.00 to cover
our costs. We accept payment via Eurocard/Mastercard or VISA. To order by credit card, specify your credit card number,
expiration date, and your name exactly as it appears on the card.
If you already purchased an Oberon version from us, we will upgrade you to a newer version for Sfr 20. The upgrading
policy applies only to versions of the same architecture; this means you cannot upgrade from an older Oberon V4 for
Windows version to a newer DOS-Oberon version or vice-versa.

Note that the ftp server {\tt hades.ethz.ch} also archives a number of Oberon ports (notably Linux and OS/2) and
several example programs and packages. The official archive of the newsletter is {\tt ftp.inf.ethz.ch} in
the {\tt /pub/Oberon/Newsletter}
directory. If you don't have ftp access we can add you to our address list.
