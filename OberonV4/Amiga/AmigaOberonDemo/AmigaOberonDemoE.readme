              [1;33;4mAmiga Oberon 3.00 (limited Version)[m


[1;33mPreface:[m

  This is a freely distributable demo  version  of  a  powerful  compiler  for
  Oberon-2. Oberon-2 is one of the most modern object-oriented languages. It's
  the   latest   development  of  Prof.  Dr.  Niklaus  Wirth  and  Prof.   Dr.
  Hanspeter Mössenböck of the ETH  Zürich.  This language  was  designed  with
  the aim to increase the power of Modula-II and to  extend  it  with  object-
  oriented facilities while reducing its complexity. To achieve this,  Oberon-
  2 was extended with the concept of type- extension,  which  enables  object-
  oriented programming comparable to Smalltalk or C++.


[1;33mSpecial features of Amiga Oberon:[m

  - parallel incremental garbage collector
  - runtime source-level debugger
  - BLink compatible object files
  - fast compilation
  - optimized code
  - language extensions to access AmigaOS
  - powerful editor
  - much more...


[1;33mUnpacking:[m

  This demo version of the Amiga Oberon System exentd two disks.  These  disks
  have been compressed to fit on one single disk. To unpack  the  disks,  just
  double select the script file 'UnPack'. If you're still using  AmigaOS  1. 3
  you'll have to enter

  to a shell window after putting this disks into drive DFx:.

  A documentation of the programs and the files of the Amiga Oberon System  is
