HP-Oberon  (TM) is an  implementation  of Oberon (TM) for  Hewlett-  Packard
Apollo Serie 700 workstations.  Both the programming  language  Oberon-2 and
the Oberon System have been implemented.  For a complete  description of the
Language and of the System, one should read the following books:

We propose to discuss  Oberon  related  topics  within the  comp.lang.oberon
newsgroup.

Files:
------

HP-Oberon is available  either via  anonymous  ftp on  ftp.inf.ethz.ch  (IP:
129.132.101.33) or on one 3 1/2 HD diskette.

The Oberon package consists of these three files:

HP-Oberon.4.*.updt.gz:  A  compressed  tar-file   containing  the  HP-Oberon
			run-time  system, the Oberon  fonts, the X-fonts and
			the  documentations.  You may use the HP-UX  command
			/etc/update  to install these  filesets,  however if
			you  cant't  use it,  you can  also  use  'tar'  for
			installing the system.

HP-Oberon.Guide.ps.gz   A  compressed   postscript   file   containing   the
			HP-Oberon User's Guide.

README			The file you are reading at present.

Installation:
-------------

STEP 1: Copy the Oberon Package onto your disk

   If you have internet access
	
      1.1 get the file from the ETH anonymous file server.
          (ftp.inf.ethz.ch:/pub/Oberon/HP700)

         % ftp ftp.inf.ethz.ch 		' ip = 129.132.101.33
         
         Name: ftp
         Password: <send your complete e-mail address as password>
	
         ftp> bin			' binary file transfer 
         ftp> prompt			' disable prompt
	 ftp> cd /pub/Oberon/HP700 	' this is where HP-Oberon files are
         ftp> mget HP-Oberon.*.updt.gz	' the HP-Oberon package
         ftp> get README		' read this before installing Oberon
         ftp> get HP-Oberon.Guide.ps.gz	' HP-Oberon Guide
	
   If you have Oberon on diskettes
	
      1.1 read the diskettes with the tar command.
          % tar xvf /dev/<...>		' replace <...> by you floppy device
          				  for example: rfloppy/c20Ad1s0
	
STEP 2: Prepare the package

   2.1 Decompress the file
      % gzip -d HP-Oberon.*.updt.gz
      
     (* 
      *  If you have internet, you can get gzip from many ftp servers and
      *  if  you  have  HP-Oberon on diskette, gzip binary is also on the
      *  diskette
      *)

   2.2 move it to the /tmp directory
      % mv HP-Oberon.*.updt /tmp
	
STEP 3: Install the package

   If you have super-user privileges
	
      3.1 Becomes super-user
         % su
         #
	
      3.2 Create a directory for Oberon
         # cd /usr/local
         # mkdir Oberon
	
      3.3 Start the update programm
         # /etc/update
	
      3.4 Choose Change Source or Destination ->
         Then From Tape Device to Local System ...
	
         Source:  /tmp/HP-Oberon.4.*.updt
         Destination Directory:  /usr/local/Oberon
	
         Press Done
	
         Your screen should look like:

 |             Select/View Partitions and Filesets ...                  |
 |                                                                      |

 +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
	
      3.5 Install the partition (see the man page of update for more
          details)
  
   If you don't have super-user rights

      3.1 Create a directory for Oberon in your home directory or any other
          directory where you have the right to
         % mkdir ~/Oberon

      3.2 change to the Oberon directory
         % cd ~/Oberon
	
      3.3  Extract the following filesets
	
         % tar xvf /tmp/HP-Oberon.*.updt OBERON-RUN
         % rm -Rf OBERON-RUN system
         % tar xvf /tmp/HP-Oberon.*.updt OBERON-S-FONTS
         % rm -Rf OBERON-S-FONTS system
         % tar xvf /tmp/HP-Oberon.*.updt OBERON-P-FONTS
         % rm -Rf OBERON-P-FONTS system
         % tar xvf /tmp/HP-Oberon.*.updt OBERON-M-FONTS
         % rm -Rf OBERON-M-FONTS system      
         	
      3.5 If you need the Oberon documentation
	
         % tar xvf /tmp/HP-Oberon.*.updt OBERON-DOCU
         % rm -Rf OBERON-DOCU system
	
      3.6 If you want faster fonts display
	
         % tar xvf /tmp/HP-Oberon.*.updt OBERON-X-FONTS
         % rm -Rf OBERON-X-FONTS system
         
      3.7 Set the file and directory permissions if necessary
      
         % chmod ...
	
STEP 4: Remove the package file

      % rm /tmp/Oberon.*.updt

STEP 5: If you installed the X-Fonts
   
      Once the X-Fonts are installed you need to extend the X fontpath by
      the new directory (I suppose that your X-Fonts are in the directory
      /usr/local/Oberon/XFonts):
      
         % xset +fp /usr/local/Oberon/XFonts

      This command can also be entered in the .login file of Oberon users:
      
         % xset -fp /usr/local/Oberon/XFonts
         % xset +fp /usr/local/Oberon/XFonts

      The first line avoids a repetition of the fontpath, if already present.

STEP 6: Set up the environment
   
      The default setting of the environment  variable OBERON, which is
      the search  path for  existing  files, is '.  /usr/local/Oberon'.
      It may be changed if needed.


Starting HP-Oberon:
-------------------

Oberon may be started  with the  command  "oberon".  Oberon  runs on top of X
Windows and HP-UX in a X window as a normal X application.

Usage:
  oberon [-h heapsizeinMB] [-x module command] [ -b bootfile]
         [-f fontmapfile] [-d displayname] [-g geometry] [-c]

Key mapping:
F1      : mark viewer (SETUP)
F2      : ESC
F3      : BREAK
F4      : Init colors
F5      : Diacritics combine key
F6..F12	: Programmable function keysSelect: LF
Ctrl-L  : redraw screen

See   how   to   type   international   character,   in  the   oberon   file
HP-Oberon.Guide.Text or print HP-Oberon.Guide.ps on a postscript printer.

Execute System.Quit to leave HP-Oberon.

If an Oberon program loops forever, it can be stopped by pressing  Ctrl-C in
the terminal window in which HP-Oberon was started.  A trap viewer will then
appear in the Oberon window.  To abort  HP-Oberon,  press Ctrl-\ in the same
terminal window.
