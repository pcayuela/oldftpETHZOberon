 Oberon for Windows (tm)

 This directory contains ETH-Oberon V4 for Microsoft Windows NT
 and Microsoft Windows 3.1. Both implementations are contained
 in the file "oberon.zip". When running under Windows 3.1,
 Oberon for Windows needs Microsoft's system extension "Win32s".
 Win32s is contained in the file "win32s.exe". Windows NT users
 or users that already have Win32s installed on their system do
 not need to download "win32s.exe".
    The file "readme.txt" is named so because we expect you
 to read it.
