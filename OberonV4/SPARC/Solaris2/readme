SPARC-Oberon (TM) V4 Release 2.9.2 (Solaris 2.x version)
========================================================

Copyright (c) 1990-1995 ETH Zurich

SPARC-Oberon is an implementation of Oberon for SPARC-based machines.
It covers both the programming language Oberon and the Oberon system
closely resembling the original implementation by N. Wirth and J. Gutknecht.
SPARC-Oberon implements the Oberon-2 language extensions.



DOCUMENTATION
-------------

SPARC-Oberon contains some basic online documentation to enable
first-time users to get started with Oberon. However, for serious work
we recommend the following books published by Addison-Wesley.
Note that "Project Oberon" contains the full source code of the Oberon 
system and compiler. The source code is also available via ftp from
neptune.inf.ethz.ch:~ftp/Oberon/Sources/ProjectOberon.tar.Z.

reference.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Cpu: SPARC
Operating system: SunOS 5.x
Mouse: three buttons
Terminal server: X11



INSTALLATION
------------

To install SPARC-Oberon from floppy disk, execute the following C-shell script.
The directory containing the Oberon installation is refered to as "Oberon"
throughout this document.
If Oberon is installed via ftp, replace "tar xf /dev/rfd0" by an appropriate
file copy command.

#csh
#   make an Oberon directory (preferably /opt/Oberon)
mkdir Oberon
#   go into this directory
cd Oberon
#   get the compressed archive oberon.tar.Z from floppy disk
tar xf /dev/rfd0
#   uncompress archive
uncompress oberon.tar.Z
#   extract all files
tar xf oberon.tar
#   eventually remove archive
rm -i oberon.tar
#   leave the Oberon directory
cd ~


SYNOPSIS
  oberon [-h heapSize] [-f fontmapfile] [-x Mod Proc] [-g geometry] [-c]

DESCRIPTION
  oberon starts the SPARC-Oberon process which may be terminated by executing
  the Oberon command System.Quit (after deleting the exclamation mark) or by
  selecting the Quit menu Item in the Window menu.
  The oberon command is usually located in /opt/Oberon/bin.

  Special characters:

    key         meaning
    ----------------------------------
    F1          mark viewer
    F2          alias to Escape
    F3          Break character
    F4          init colors
    F6..F10 (+Shift, +Ctrl, +Ctrl-Shift)
                characters beyond 127.
    Ctrl-L      redraw all viewers

  Keyboard interrupts may be generated by sending the oberon process a
  SIGINT signal (e.g. kill -2 pid).

OPTIONS
  -h heapSize
      set heap size to specified number of bytes.
      If not specified, 2 MB are used for the Oberon heap.

  -f fontmapfile
      defines that font names should be mapped according to fontmapfile.
      If option -f is not specified, no font mapping is performed.
      The main purpose of this option is to map fonts to bigger ones on 
      displays with very small or unsharp pixels such as color monitors or
      for video projection.
      The file Big.Map is provided as an example for enlarging fonts.
      If a font mapping is performed, the result of printing documents will 
      not be exact. Therefore, if you want to get hight quality printing 
      results, don't use this option. 
      Note that the meaning of this option has been changed over
      previous versions of SPARC-Oberon.

  -x Mod Proc
      execute command Mod.Proc.
      If not specified, Oberon.Loop is executed.

  -g geometry
      specify the size of the Oberon window.
      Note that the geometry option is taken as a hint, not as a command,
      by the window manager.

  -c
      request 256 colors from the window manager. If not specified,
      Oberon requests 16 colors only.



ENVIRONMENT
  OBERON
    A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for files.
    If OBERON is not defined, .:/opt/Oberon is taken as default.
    Note that shell specific characters like "~" are not supported by Oberon.
    The environment variable OBERON may be set e.g. under the C-shell by
    % setenv OBERON .:Mylib:Oberon.


  LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for shared
    object libraries. Oberon links libc.1 and libX11.4
    at execution time (via calls to dlopen).



We propose to discuss Oberon related questions in comp.lang.oberon on usenet.
Any problems or comments may also be reported via e-mail to oberon@inf.ethz.ch.
