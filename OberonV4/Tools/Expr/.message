This directory offers a package for editing and displaying mathematical
expressions within text documents and for interfacing mathematical software,
i.e. for symbolic computing.

This software is a research prototype. No warranties can be assumed.

For more details see the README file in this directory.

The software is made available in source. Compiled versions are no longer
supported. Please compile the modules for your environment yourself. Some
example documents are also made available, serving for documentation
purposes. A more detailed describtion of the project, the concepts, and the
implementation can be found in:
