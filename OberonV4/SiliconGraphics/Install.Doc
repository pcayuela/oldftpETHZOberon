SGIoberon (TM) is an implementation of Oberon (TM) for Silicon
Graphics workstations. Both the programming language
Oberon-2 and the Oberon System have been implemented.
For a complete description of the Language and of the System,
one should read the following books:

N. Wirth and M. Reiser: Programming in Oberon. Steps beyond Pascal
and Modula_2. Addison Wesley, 1992, ISBN 0-201-56543-9.
(Tutorial for the Oberon programming language and concise language
reference.)

M. Reiser: The Oberon System. User Guide and Programmer's Manual.
Addison Wesley, 1991, ISBN 0-201-54422-9.
(User manual for the programming environment and reference for the
standard module library.)

N. Wirth and J. Gutknecht: Project Oberon. The Design of an Operating
System and Compiler.
Addison Wesley, 1992, ISBN 0-201-54428-8.
(Program listings with explanations for the whole Oberon system,
including the compiler for NS32000.)

H. Moessenboeck: Object-Oriented Programming in Oberon-2
Springer-Verlag, 1993, ISBN 0-387-56411-X.
(Principles and applications of object_oriented programming with
examples in Oberon_2.)

For a description of the Oberon-2 language:
Hanspeter Moessenboeck,
Differences between Oberon and Oberon-2,
The Programming Language Oberon-2,
Report  160, Departement Informatik, ETH Zurich.
Also present as on-line documentation in this Oberon release.

We propose to discuss Oberon related topics within the
comp.lang.oberon newsgroup. 

Files on neptune.inf.ethz.ch:Oberon/SiliconGraphics
----------------------------------------------
SGIoberon.4.2.tar.Z
        compressed tar-file containing SGIoberon.
        You may use the Unix commands "uncompress" and "tar"
        to unpack all the files.
        The file oberon is the executable (chmod +x oberon).

Oberon.Fonts.tar.Z
       compressed file containing the Oberon fonts

SGIoberon.Guide.ps.Z
       compressed postscript file containing the SGIoberon User's
       Guide

Fixups
       directory containing improved file versions

Installation:
-------------
Copy all the files into a directory. This directory may be used
as public directory by several Oberon users. The preferred one
is /usr/local/Oberon. It should be made readonly.
The default setting of the environment variable OBERON, which
is the search path for existing files, is '. /usr/local/Oberon'.
It may be changed if needed.
Each user can set a symbolic link to oberon in his working directory:
ln -s /usr/local/Oberon/oberon oberon
or add an entry in his environment variable PATH.

To improve the character drawing speed, the Oberon fonts
should be installed as X fonts. See InstallXFonts.Tool for
the font installation.

Starting Oberon:
-------------------
Oberon may be started with the command "oberon".
Oberon runs on top of X Windows and Ultrix in a X window
as a normal X application.

Usage: oberon [-h heapsizeinMB] [-x module command] [ -b bootfile]
              [-f fontmapfile] [-d displayname] [-g geometry] [-c]

Key mapping:
F1: mark viewer (SETUP)
F2: Escape
F3: BREAK
F4: init colors
Select, Ctrl-J: line feed
Ctrl-L: redraw screen

Diaeresis, grave, acute, and circumflex characters can be typed
using the usual compose sequence or an international keyboard.
A third way of composing them is to type the letter and the diacritic
in any order and then press the function key F5 (or the key Do)
in order to combine the two symbols into a diacritical character.
Valid diacritics are: { ' ` " ^ , ~ }

Execute System.Quit to leave SGIoberon.

If an Oberon program loops forever, it can be stopped
by pressing Ctrl-C in the terminal window in which SGIoberon
was started. A trap viewer will then appear in the Oberon window.
To abort SGIoberon, press Ctrl-\ in the same terminal window.
